"Las Ventanas Al Paraiso, A Rosewood Resort",Architecture,Dallas/Mexico City,"To design an intimate luxury resort, melding the stark desert environment and Pacific Ocean with the rich history, culture and climate of the Baja peninsula.
Blurring the line between indoors and out, the HKS-led design team took its cues from the site's natural surroundings on the Sea of Cortez&#8217;s white sand beaches and mountainous desert elements. Stairs, bridges and curving paths connect low-rise, angular buildings with white stucco walls. The suites’ full-height doors of wood and glass frame expansive ocean views. The 18-acre property responds to regional influences found along the Pacific Coast of Baja California Sur as its five dozen suites seamlessly melt into the sloping terrain. Each guest suite focuses on water for sight, sound and feel, creating a guest experience of complete escape and exclusivity.
The resort's thoughtfully considered programmatic design elements ensured that back-of-house functions are almost completely concealed from guest circulation areas, lending a feel of considerable guest privacy and intimacy. The project carried home-grown impact too, as local artisans and workers were hired for the construction and craftsmanship of the resort.","280,000 square feet

MGM National Harbor,Architecture/Mixed-Use/Sustainable Design/LINE,"Dallas/Washington, D.C.","A preference for “white architecture” was established to respect the marble structures in the District of Columbia and the client's vision called for a landmark tower inspired by the Washington Monument.
MGM National Harbor draws inspiration from the strength and timeless qualities of the capital's architectural legacy and achieves its monumental scale through a single architectural gesture: a massive plinth, or base, which supports the primary program elements above. HKS designers organized it along a central spine – like the National Mall – connecting one sequence of guest experiences to the next. Guests enter the property through an oval conservatory bathed in natural light. The 80-foot tall conservatory is lined with restaurants and high-end shopping.
Rising 24-stories, the hotel tower is the project's landmark. Its angled and knife-like edge recalls the strong vertical form of the Washington Monument. The tower is rotated 33 degrees from the project's axis to be parallel with the National Mall, deepening the relationship between the site and the heart of the District.
A landscaped roof deck provides a gathering space and an expansive area for indoor-outdoor dining. A digital façade, cantilevered off the point of the plinth, adds visual energy and brand identity. A bold, sweeping roof embraces the plaza to connect guests to unobstructed and panoramic views of the Potomac River and the Capital.
MGM National Harbor is a premier entertainment destination and the first luxury gaming resort in the Capital Region, employing 3,700 people. The hotel reached capacity 242 nights during its first year of operation and totaled more than 6 million visitors.","1.7 Million square feet

Four Seasons Resort Sharm El Sheikh,Architecture,Dallas/San Francisco/London,"Design a five-star luxury resort in the vernacular of traditional hillside towns of the Mediterranean and Middle East, taking advantage of the steeply sloping site and its dramatic views of the Red Sea.
Forms and details reminiscent of the hillside towns of Northern Africa inspired the design, which incorporates the use of powerful domes and Islamic style arches built of simple brick, plaster and wood, giving strength to the architectural forms. The hotel villas are integrated into the steep slopes of the Sinai Peninsula to evoke an ancient hillside village. Courtyards cooled by fountains and shaded by canopies of tall palms provide gateways to the guestrooms, all of which have alluring sea views. Each guestroom is designed as a suite with a separate bedroom, parlor space, full-sized terraces and an over-sized full bath. Designers planned each building's orientation, location, size and openings to increase natural light and cross ventilation. Thick masonry walls radiate heat back to the outside in the evening when the air cools. Shading techniques, deep recesses and awnings shield windows, doors and outdoor patios from direct sunlight. Originally opened in 2002, designers completed a 90-key expansion with 21 villas, an entertainment village and conference center in 2012. HKS and Brayton Hughes Design Studios collaborated to work on the resort architecture and interiors for both the original and expansion projects.
As one of the first luxury resorts built on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, the Four Seasons Sharm El Sheikh set the tone resorts that followed. Sharm El Sheikh is often called the “City of Peace” for the large number of international peace conferences hosted there.","185,000 square feet

The Farm at Crossroad Commons,Architecture/Mixed-Use/Urban Design/Research/Sustainable Design,Dallas/New York,"With its ideal climate and soil conditions, Lake County enjoys a long and productive agricultural tradition. However, development patterns in recent decades have converted this vital resource into buildings, pavement and soil depleting monoculture crops. HKS’ design intends to unlock the site's potential and return it to its roots, evoking Northwest Indiana's rich agricultural heritage.
Through sophisticated integration of ecology and history, innovative performance-based design and advanced environmental systems, HKS proposed an ambitious masterplan development that reconnects the community to one of its most valued resources: the land.
The Farm at Crossroad Commons is Merrillville lost and re-found.  HKS’ vision for the masterplan is grounded in deep appreciation and understanding of the community's land, culture, history, and ecology.
This is manifest in HKS, OJB and Sherwood's response to the regional drivers of the area's food desert, degraded hydrology, and need for community connectivity. The agricultural history, quality of soils, and the educational value of community farming based in polycultures are the framework for the plan and program.
The site creates a raw interface between the architecture that equally supports the people and the agriculture of the region that has historically provided for them. 
Abundant amenities provide health, wellness, and education through diversified agricultural production and livestock. Farm-to-table restaurants tap produce grown on the farm, and the microbrewery and distillery use hops and wheat grown just a stone's throw away. The visitor's center and greenhouse, equestrian arena, farmer's market and more offer a variety hands-on activities and engagement.
The meeting and event conference center situated at the project's heart knits the project into one cohesive development featuring uniquely Indiana, one-of-a-kind offerings that celebrate the community and bring the region together as visitors experience a holistic style of living.
The arts and cultural programming provide community engagement and educational opportunities as well, with an art gallery and a traveling art exhibit, environmental urban art, and a living artist studio as an integral feature of the development.
The Farm provides economic opportunities for a new generation of farmers and access to local and healthy foods that decrease the region's reliance on imported and processed foods – a major contributor to health problems like obesity and diabetes.
The estimated $350 million private-public investment project is expected to create 600 construction jobs, 1,000 permanent jobs and nearly $100 million in new local, regional and state tax revenues over 10 years.","Working, education-based 27 acre farm

Omni Nashville Hotel,Architecture/Sustainable Design,Dallas,"Seamlessly connect a new high-rise hotel to the Country Music Hall of Fame and the surrounding district, both filled with their own distinct cultures and character.
The Omni Nashville incorporates energized streetscapes to minimize the “big-box” development feel. Grand sidewalks, native landscaping, vintage lighting and pedestrian-oriented facades create a warm, street focused atmosphere. A modern expression of Nashville's spirit, the hotel's exposed steel, soaring glass facades and regionally sourced limestone are incorporated with a strong sense of human scale. The overall mass is articulated into a series of distinct sections that successfully break down the overall scale of the hotel's 17 stories. Four of the hotel's floors directly connect to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. The Omni's other attractions range from an in-house “honky-tonk” to a local coffeehouse that invites passerby to come in and explore the hotel. The hotel's sustainable measures include harvested groundwater for landscape irrigation, plumbing fixtures that cut water consumption by nearly 30 percent, extensive usage of regionally sourced and recycled materials, low-VOC paints and coatings, and sustainably harvested wood. HKS was joined on the project by Earl Swensson Associates and Tuck-Hinton Architects. Looney &amp; Associates was responsible for interior design.
Omni Nashville resides at the forefront of the city's urban expansion and provides a catalyst for the city's future development and growth. The design leverages the Hall of Fame's 200,000 square-foot expansion to anchor the hotel to the heart of the Music City, and star-studded amenities and proximity to a wealth of local attractions make this hotel an attractive location for event planners, travelers and locals alike. This project was awarded a LEED Silver certification.",,
Omni Louisville Hotel,Architecture,Dallas,"Design an urban hotel that supports Louisville's growing reputation as a top convention destination and revitalize an under-utilized downtown block to stimulate the local economy. Contextually, the hotel's design should reflect the essence, charm and heritage of Kentucky.
Built on the site of the former Louisville Water Co., the Omni Louisville Hotel weaves the city's historic past within a comfortable setting adorned with touches of modern luxury. The lobby is designed to resemble a deconstructed bourbon barrel to immerse guests in Kentucky's rich bourbon heritage upon arrival. A prominent landmark against the Louisville skyline, the intersection of hotel and residential towers are uniquely expressed as bold overlapping architectural forms. The ground level is designed to embrace the neighborhood with vibrant spaces for both locals and hotel guests. Restaurant tenants can open doors and walls to provide guests with indoor or outdoor dining options. The hotel is a seven-minute walk to the Louisville Convention Center and a seven-mile drive from the airport, making it a major draw for meeting planners. The Omni's amenities include a rooftop pool and bar with downtown skyline views, bourbon tasting room, a speakeasy with regulation-size bowling lanes and a neighborhood market with groceries, hot foods, a taco truck, brick-oven pizza and craft beer.
The LEED Silver certified Omni Hotel has energized and activated an under-utilized area of downtown in addition to creating 500 permanent jobs.

"The Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort",Architecture,Dallas/Miami,"The Ocean Club expansion and renovation focused on revitalizing the resorts’ historic Hartford Wing – a private estate until 1962 – while retaining its original classical architectural character.
The resort's extensive five-month renovation included transforming the Hartford Wing's exterior courtyard, interior redesign and expansion of all 55 guest rooms, plus the expansion of bathrooms and balconies or terraces with lush garden and ocean-facing views. The project's new amenities added a 125-foot infinity-edge pool with 180-degree Atlantic Ocean views. Other amenities include a poolside bar and grill, spa and fitness center, restaurant, retail and a refresh of existing hotel and public gathering spaces.
HKS collaborated with interior designer Jeffrey Beers of Jeffrey Beers International on the Hartford Wing restyled guest room renovation. The design team drew inspiration from the resort's original Bahamian British Colonial architectural aesthetic, adding crisp and contemporary wood and stone materials layered with Caribbean-hued fabrics, textures and finishes to convey a refined yet comfortable and informal island spirit.
The resort's modern guest room refresh lends a deep sense of relaxation and serenity, balanced by new amenities that beckons guests to explore.
The transformation raised the bar for the luxury guest experience in the Caribbean while retaining The Ocean Club's rich history, sense of privacy and coveted beachfront exclusivity.","26-acre resort

TEXRail Station at DFW International Airport Terminal B,Architecture,Dallas,"TEXRail is a new 27-mile commuter rail line linking downtown Fort Worth to DFW International Airport's Terminal B. As on-call architect for DFW Airport, HKS was awarded the contract in 2015 to provide design and construction of the TEXRail Station at Terminal B, and the passenger walkway leading to Terminal B. In addition to its location within a busy hub airport and a firm opening date of January 2019, the project team faced other challenges, including existing utility obstructions, a natural gas line that needed relocating and the presence of asbestos uncovered by demolition of the remaining Airtrans guideway and associated facilities. Dealing with the utility obstructions and devising a plan to ensure proper removal and disposal of the asbestos could have caused significant delays in the project schedule.
As the originating/destination point for thousands of passengers each day, designers looked to create a space that would be consistent with the nearby DART station built in 2012. They also wanted to provide an efficient, pleasing customer experience as passengers transitioned from the TEXRail Station to the terminal. The design of the station incorporates elements of the DART terminal, including clean, open spaces, with a well-designed signage and orientation system and dramatic curving canopies over the station. Showcasing DFW Airport as a global transportation hub, HKS architects created a mural along the pedestrian walkway depicting graphic representations of major international cities.
HKS leveraged its experience as on-call architect for the airport, working closely with the client, project contractor and numerous airport stakeholders to help keep the project on schedule. An airport is like a small city, with a network of departments that keep it operating smoothly. HKS used its knowledge of the stakeholders and their protocols to translate their requirements into the overall planning. Through weekly alignment meetings and close coordination with the airport project team, HKS helped maintain the construction schedule with no disruption to critical airport operations — despite severe weather, road closures and temporary rerouting of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
The new TEXRail service is critical to the continued growth and vibrancy of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, bringing new economic development opportunities along the 27-mile line. TEXRail is the first public transportation option to directly connect DFW Airport to downtown Fort Worth. In addition to providing direct access to Fort Worth, one of the fastest growing cities in the country, it offers a convenient, affordable transportation option for airport employees and people who work along the route. Daily ridership is expected to grow from 8,000 at the end of the first year of operation, to 14,000 by 2035.","16,500 square feet

Norton Women’s and Kosair Children’s Hospital,Interior Design/Architecture/Urban Design,Dallas/Detroit/Phoenix,"Building for today with a plan for tomorrow, this specialty hospital for women and children challenged designers to redesign and expand their space to create a setting for holistic services and compassionate care for vulnerable patients.
Inspired by the wonder and discovery of nature, the curvilinear building features several key moments of escape. The design features multiple daylight-filled walkways leading to a rooftop garden, encouraging a connection to the outdoors and its healing properties. A multi-colored glass exterior creates serene indoor lighting that shifts with the changing daylight, while a labyrinth offers an opportunity for meditation and privacy.
Because of space limitations, the project has a vertical design with new floors built over the existing intensive care unit and emergency department. Additions include a 16-bed ICU, a 40-bed NICU, 33 medical and surgical beds, impatient migraine treatment, the Norton Cancer Institute and a breast health center.
Completed with associate architects, Laughlin Millea Hillman Architecture of Louisville, a phased construction process allowed for uninterrupted use of the facility during the renovation and construction. Many spaces, including the oncology department, workout rooms and NICU, feature flexible furniture and partitions that allow flexibility based on patient needs rather than fixed bed counts.","16-bed ICU

ParkwayHealth Gleneagles Shanghai International Hospital,Architecture/Interior Design,Dallas/Shanghai/Singapore,"Design a multi-specialty general hospital that supports Shanghai's transformation into a medical tourism destination that also supports the local population.
The building design was inspired by the study of transformational processes. The building's skin is specifically tuned to the environment by minimizing direct heat gain while maximizing daylighting. Other key attributes of the design include access to nature via balconies and roof gardens throughout the building, as well as a reduced tower footprint that improves natural lighting and ventilation.
The project is a part of the New Hongqiao International Medical Center masterplan. Its proximity to Hongqiao International Airport and the Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station provides accessibility to patients from across Asia and beyond.
Opening in 2020, ParkwayHealth Gleneagles Shanghai is key to the company's growth in China.

JPMorgan Chase Regional Headquarters,Architecture/Interior Design/Branded Experiences/Mixed-Use/Sustainable Design,Dallas/Chicago,"To design a regional headquarters that attracts and retains top employees to its collaborative, interactive and engaged corporate campus with a design inspired by Texas art and landscape.
The new JPMorgan Chase regional headquarters is a 50-acre campus with three office buildings built to accommodate 6,000 employees. The campus features contemporary amenities including a wellness center, a child care center, multiple art installations, a cafeteria, a Starbucks, and public plazas between buildings. The sustainably-designed campus is LEED Gold certified.
Donald Judd, the minimal artist known for his landscape installations in Marfa, Texas, was the inspiration behind the workplace interiors. Quoting Judd, HKS designers sought to use “just enough design to solve the problem at hand.” Raw materials such as steel and an exposed concrete structure provide a backdrop for artistic details including florescent tube lights, a nod to Judd's friend, modern artist Dan Flavin.
With the new headquarters, Chase now joins Liberty Mutual Insurance, Toyota and FedEx Office as large employers at Legacy West. More than 15,000 people are expected to eventually work at Legacy West, which would make it one of the large job sites in Texas.",,
Texas Live! By Loews,Architecture/Interior Design,Dallas,"To help establish the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area as one of America's top tourism and convention destinations, the well-established Loews hotel brand challenged designers to create the ultimate urban destination between AT&amp;T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, and the under-construction Globe Life Field, the new home of the Texas Rangers. Both of those projects were also designed by HKS.
The design takes cues from the plateaus of the wild west and signature Texan hospitality. Guests are greeted by an oversized fireplace and a view of AT&amp;T stadium framed perfectly beyond the bar, while a monumental staircase connects to a two-level ballroom and convention center. The open feel of the project allows guests to gather and socialize before, during and after contests at either of the two stadiums and provides easy access to both.
Texas Live! is expected to create approximately 3,025 jobs in the city of Arlington and Tarrant County, and it is expected to lead to $100 million per year in economic impact in the first 40 years.","302-key Loews hotel

Grand Solmar at Rancho San Lucas Resort,Architecture/Urban Design,Dallas/Miami/Mexico City,"Classic Cabo San Lucas Hotelier Solmar recognized that savvy vacationers were reconsidering their ideas of luxury and seeking greater personalization in their travel experiences. In a departure from typical all-encompassing resort models, they sought to develop a more natural and open-ended experience. The designers were challenged to complement this remote setting and bring a new flavor to its existing beachfront properties on the southern tip of the peninsula.
The 600-key resort on the Pacific side of Cabo San Lucas was developed around windswept sand dunes and 100-year-old arroyos. Natural curves, views, and site opportunities guided the planning of the site, which includes 43 buildings, a salt water lagoon, luxurious spa facilities and a ballroom and business center. The breezy property, surrounded by desert landscape, highlights indoor-outdoor connections, and provides continuity with its sister properties through the use of vernacular materials and the resort's signature cupula motif.
Solmar's resort on a pristine desert landscape lets vacationers experience the allure of a private oasis while enjoying the amenities of a luxury suite.

Optus Stadium,Architecture/Interior Design/Alternative Project Delivery,Dallas/London,"To design a stadium that meets the dual goal of serving as a multipurpose modern sports facility as well as a useful destination for citizens and non-sporting activities.
Optus Stadium is home to both the West Coast Eagles and the Fremantle Dockers of the Australian Rules Football League. Designers used anodized aluminum on the stadium's bronze façade to reflect the special geology of Western Australia by day, and a 15,000-light LED system at night that can highlight the team colors of either the Eagles or the Dockers. The pitch is oval-shaped to accommodate cricket matches in addition to other types of sporting events. Designers also lowered the seating bowl to give fans exceptional views and bring them closer to the action on the field. The structure's lightweight fabric roof, created specifically for the stadium, provides shelter to 85 percent of the facility&#8217;s 60,000-seats. The project's responsible design not only celebrates the six seasons recognized by Australia's indigenous community, it also includes a network of walking and cycling trails, as well as playgrounds, picnic areas and a boardwalk for use by the public. HKS is part of the WESTADIUM consortium that includes Hassell Studio and Cox Architecture.
Optus Stadium will host a variety of events including cricket and soccer matches and major concerts, in addition to Australian Rules Football contests. Non-sports enthusiasts who come to the area around the stadium will have access to an amphitheater, children's playgrounds and picnic areas.

CapitalMED Medical City,Mixed-Use/Architecture/Interior Design/Advisory Services/LINE,"Washington, D.C./London/Richmond/Dubai/Dallas","Egyptians for Healthcare Services (EHCS) has a vision for a medical destination that will revolutionize the health care industry in the region and attract medical tourism to Egypt. The project is in an area that is challenged by wealth gaps, economic turmoil and access to high quality health care. Dr. Hassan el Kalla, CEO and chairman of the board for EHCS, said the primary tenet of the project is to “create an environment where doctors and patients from all over the world want to practice and heal.”
HKS designed an interconnected green campus featuring a teaching hospital, specialized medical centers, offices, mixed-use retail and extended-stay housing. Located across from New Capital City in central Cairo, the campus is inspired by the extraordinary history and architecture of Egypt. As an academic medical center, education is also a central focus with a dedicated simulation center, education classrooms and living facilities onsite.

Rosewood Puerto Papagayo,Architecture,Dallas,"The pristine northwest coastline of Costa Rica within Guanacaste Province on the Gulf of Papagayo is treasured for its tropical forests, varied wildlife and white sand beaches. The design approach required great sensitivity to the site's natural contours, treading lightly and integrating with the native landscape and ecosystem. Rugged landscape and sweeping ocean views are major design drivers. The site&#8217;s natural setting provides natural shading and engagement, but changes from wet to dry with the seasons, requiring the design team to understand the exposure the structures provide and their impact on guest comfort and privacy.
The architecture maximizes views by delicately lifting the structures up from the ground, gently integrating into the natural landscape and ecosystem. The terraced, low-rise, open-air structures are decentralized and sprinkled throughout the site to take full advantage of ocean vistas while amplifying privacy and tranquility. Minimized pathways alleviate scaring to the hills, allowing guests to maneuver laterally and vertically through the site comfortably and naturally.
The pools are gently cut out naturally through the site, allowing water to cascade down through the main spine of the resort, becoming a natural wayfinding element.
The signature treehouse suites offer guests intimate engagement with the Costa Rican eco-environment. The two-story suites emulate a butterfly cocoon that lift from the ground, bypassing treetop canopies that are accessed via trails and hanging bridges, creating an immersive experience with nature.
Rosewood Puerto Papagayo radiates Costa Rican character with its use of locally sourced stone, hardwoods, artwork and handcrafted textiles and furnishings by local artisans, creating an authentic connection to this one-of-a-kind place.","130 guest rooms, including seven two-story treehouse suites

Kuwait Children’s Hospital,Architecture/Interior Design/Advisory Services/LINE,Dubai/Richmond/London/Dallas/Miami,"To design the largest children&#8217;s hospital in the world, of significance to national, regional and global health care precedence. It is the first consolidated pediatric care model in the Middle East, designed experientially, through variance in scale.
HKS architects proposed a crystalline design connecting the historic traditions of science, healing, and the life-supporting nature of water. The podium's solid masonry shell wraps the precious treatment functions it protects. The healing tower rises above with a glimmering façade of facetted metals and glass, reflecting and filtering light through a layered shade screen.
Building surface materials—masonry, metal, and glass—and their treatments respond to the harsh environmental conditions of the desert. Penetrations in the skin allow windows and ventilation points, each derived from the triangular crystal form of the overall concept.
Inpatient rooms are located on both east and west faces of the Ward Tower. They are accessed from the rest of the hospital by central vertical circulation cores which handle and separate patient, visitor, staff, and service access. Each bedroom, thanks to its non-orthogonal geometry, has a directed view to the sea and they can accommodate two family members to stay overnight with the patient.
Public areas include a 375m-long (1,240 feet) enclosed atrium, 30m in height. The atrium is conceived as an underwater scene of larger-than-life sea creatures that become ambassadors for the patient journey. “The Great Sea Adventure” tells the story of the local Kuwaiti marine ecology and an oceanic heritage.
Illuminated fish suspend from the ceiling, occupiable turtles sit upon puppet-like stilts and are accessed from the upper floors across bridges. A blue whale hosts a sibling play area and gaming theatre while a shark contains one of two public cafes.
The atrium was designed not as a health care environment, but akin to a civically-scaled entertainment complex intended for community engagement, positive distraction, and national pride.
Kuwait Children's Hospital is positioned to be the largest children's hospital in the world at 595,000 square meters (6.4 million square feet) and was delivered with a forward-thinking design that incorporates state-of-the-art technology and energy conservation.

Pacific Plaza Park Pavilion,Architecture/LINE,Dallas,"Designing within a dense urban area poses unique challenges, and the pavilion within the city of Dallas’ downtown Pacific Park Plaza park was no exception. The location is surrounded by tall buildings, requiring that the pavilion look appealing from a bird's eye view as well as at pedestrian level. In addition, any construction had to avoid interfering with the sightline through the park, an important element when enticing passersby on all sides to enter.
HKS designed the Pavilion to connect with itself and its elliptical shape is appealing from a skyscraper window. The Pavilion itself sits approximately 15 feet above the ground and is supported by 11 columns. These cruciform columns are angled to appear as thin as possible, preserving the sightlines through the park.
Like many cities, Dallas is eager to re-create its downtown district to appeal to residents and workers. The Pavilion is part of an ongoing initiative to develop more parks in downtown Dallas and serves as a key element in the city's “green link” of parks that will run through and connect several disparate Dallas neighborhoods.","4,600 square feet

Alcon Novartis Dining Facility,Architecture/Interior Design/LINE,Dallas,"A typical dining facility backs the kitchen area to one side of the building, but Novartis asked for a centralized kitchen with dining areas that wrap around it. That way diners can enjoy the view through the glass walls from every angle and employees in the surrounding buildings have a view inside. The transparent building makes the centrally-located facility appealing from all angles, but glass walls pose challenges to managing the thermal and visual effects of sunlight.
HKS’ design enables 270 degrees of dining areas on the perimeter of the building's interior and includes various seating layouts to promote meetings of all sizes. The centralized kitchen is separated from infrastructure used by other elements, like bathrooms, to stretch the dining area.
Managing the sun's effect couldn’t be done the same way on all sides of the building. The south side of the building has a protruding shade, angled upward, that has been precisely shaped to block just enough sunlight at specific times of the day. The north side's glass face is affixed with vertical blades of laminated glass that are carefully spaced to provide shade while preserving the view in and out of the building.
Nearly 500 researchers who study various aspects of medical technologies now have a place to congregate.

"San Francisco International Airport's Harvey Milk Terminal 1, Boarding Area B",Architecture/Alternative Project Delivery/Sustainable Design,San Francisco/Dallas,"To deliver SFO's Boarding Area B, HKS became fully immersed in the airport&#8217;s paradigm for Exceptional Project Outcomes (EOP) which encompassed all project aspects with a focused passion on design, project management, construction, economics, business and sustainability. All joint venture partners committed to a multi-year collaboration in the ‘Big Room’ with the architects, Design-Build teams, core trades, program managers and airport leadership and staff. Key design challenges included defining the program and footprint for the new boarding area while keeping the existing terminal and airfield operational with minimal disruption; delivering a new level of service and standards; incorporating the latest technology, industry trends and aviation processing to future-proof the facility; and fulfilling the airport's ambitious sustainable and healthy building outcome goals.
Focusing on the passenger experience, the design creates a calm and curated journey: a generous central concourse features intuitive wayfinding, advanced acoustics and lighting, art galleries, comfortable furnishings and plentiful amenities and food halls offering Bay Area fare. Radiant heating and cooling, dynamic glazing and 5-filter carbon air filtration systems create a comfortable ambience while meeting SFO's healthy building and sustainability goals.
The project design evokes a ‘Bay Area Naturalism’ theme supported by natural materials and colors that underscore the region's environment. New technologies, improved functionality and operations were key design drivers. This project initiates SFO's vision – incorporating next generation building systems, aviation trends and setting innovation standards – for the entire airport. Despite the complexities of upgrading to new systems, SFO will reap long-term benefits of operating common use gates, building management systems, North America's first ICS baggage handling system and all-electric shared-use ramp service vehicles.
SFO&#8217;s Boarding Area B embodies future-forward design, creating a positive passenger experience unique to San Francisco while providing efficient, smart and sustainable facilities for the airlines and SFO alike. SFO has achieved some notable “firsts,” including operating the first ICS baggage handling system in North America. It is the first common use terminal at SFO and provides the first gender neutral restroom facilities at the airport. The project will achieve USGBC LEED Gold certification, and it has LEED Platinum-ready and Net Zero energy-ready installations in place. The project will also achieve a 50% Energy Use Intensity (EUI) reduction. HKS delivered this complex and multifaceted project on-time and on-budget.",,
Jajalpa Office Park,Architecture,Dallas/Mexico City,"To create a unique commercial office park that stands out from other offerings around Mexico City.
Defined by surrounding green spaces and water features, a manicured park serves as the building's main entrance and offices will look out over the tree tops and toward the nearby mountains. More than 80 percent of the building's materials are sourced from local suppliers and 90 percent of the water is reused on-site for irrigation and other needs. A concrete and glass skybridge will connect the first phase of Jajalpa to the office park's future buildings. The building's location, efficient floor plan and commercial services differentiate it from other real estate offerings throughout the Mexico City region. A feature staircase encourages users to be more active while also providing illumination for the park at night. The park, dining and retail amenities encourage community engagement, while also providing space for local commerce to develop.

Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center Outpatient Building,Architecture/Interior Design,Orlando/Dallas,"Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center's goal is to become the primary destination for cancer treatment in its region. To realize this vision, Baptist MD Anderson challenged HKS and FreemanWhite, to design an iconic outpatient building on a tight urban site that would maximize staff performance and improve the patient experience.
Offering a comprehensive range of options for adult cancer patients, the cancer center houses clinical oncology, radiology, imaging, infusion, research, physician offices and support services such as nutrition, care coordination and genetic counseling. The building also contains a Walgreen's Retail Pharmacy, Life Spa for patients and an emotional support center.
In the design of the cancer center, HKS designers, in association with FreemanWhite, strove for flexible, smart and innovative solutions throughout. Modular, prefabricated building materials allowed for shorter fabrication and installation times while maintaining a high level of quality control, ultimately leading to innovative design and reduced costs.
Flexible clinic modules can be used for numerous specialties and adjusted to meet current patient population needs. They also increase staff familiarity and productivity, which in turn improves patient satisfaction.
The facility wraps around a central landscaped courtyard that provides a peaceful and calming environment for patients and their families. It also brings light deep into the building at every floor. The interior features sophisticated and calming materials that exemplify the importance of healthy buildings and healthy living. Additionally, an extensive art collection supplements the interior and exterior design providing another level of interaction and wellness.
Extensive passive solar shading, high performance glass, occupancy and light sensors in-conjunction with 100 percent LED lighting throughout the facility resulted in estimated energy savings of more than 15 percent.
Site design also enabled the creation of two parks; a gift to the community that enabled interaction with the building and its landscape. Paving and sidewalks were configured to promote pedestrian activity and link to a planned bike trail.
After the 100-year flood elevation was breached in 2017 by Hurricane Irma during construction, the design team responded by designing in flood barrier systems to enhance the capabilities of the facility to remain in operation and provide shelter in an emergency.
In addition, the Baptist campus is ideally located between the San Marco neighborhood and downtown Jacksonville and adjacent to the St. John's River with Interstate 95 bisecting the campus. The design for the new cancer center should serve as a catalyst to connect all three parts of the city through its bold and site-sensitive design.","322,710 square feet

Northwestern Memorial Hospital Emergency Department Renovation,Architecture/Interior Design,Chicago/Dallas/San Diego,"To create an environment in which Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) can offer the best care for the 110,000 patients who come to the emergency department (ED) annually. Northwestern challenged our team to create an environment that would improve patient satisfaction, offer greater privacy, increase security and improve treatment team communication.
The HKS design improves patient privacy by creating a welcoming environment that fosters upmost discretion. Designers considered what patients need during every step of their journey, whether waiting for results, receiving treatment, or discussing results and next steps with providers. To improve security, we designed a sequence of spaces ranging from secure entryways to safe rooms, infectious disease treatment areas and secure interior doors that can divide the ED into separate units. The goal is to offer everyone in the ED a secure environment that is easily, reliably controlled. Finally, the design also improves treatment team communication. Team stations throughout the ED that have a similar design language so that as staff rotate through the ED, they are familiar with their environment.
Using an evidence-based design approach, we created an innovative new element within the ED which we call ED pods. These compact environments are inspired by first-class seating in airlines, where many people are comfortably served by a small number of staff. ED pods enable more patients to be treated throughout the ED in less space, in less time with a higher level of amenity and comfort. The pods are approximately ¼ the size of typical exam room, yet contain:
<ol>
<li>An adjustable, ergonomic recliner that converts into a treatment stretcher at a moment's notice.</li>
<li>Lighting that the patient and medical staff can control, with three distinct settings: exam, relaxation, intermediate.</li>
<li>A curved wall behind the patient focuses sound traveling between caregiver and patient to increase privacy.</li>
<li>The curved wall also discretely stores medical supplies including oxygen, vacuum, physiologic monitoring, thermometers, sharps, gloves.</li>
<li>A collapsible chair for one family member.</li>
<li>Storage for patient belongings, and power to charge their electronic devices.</li>
</ol>
The redesign enables NMH to move patients in and out of the ED more quickly in an environment that conveys compassion, offers a higher level of safety than the previous space, and enables treatment teams to offer seamless, highly efficient care. By introducing different kinds of spaces for assessment, treatment, observation and waiting for results, the new design reduces wait times between steps in the patient journey.","15,000 square feet

W Hotel Bellevue,Mixed-Use/Interior Design/Architecture,Dallas/San Francisco/Los Angeles,"Create a unique identity for a new W Hotel in Bellevue, which sits just across Lake Washington from Seattle. Bellevue, the home of Microsoft, is often seen as a community living in the shadow of its more famous and celebrated neighbor.
To create an experience unique to Bellevue, the design team had to seek out the threads of local history as well as contemporary influences to weave together the narrative that became the backbone and driver for all design decisions.
The design narrative is drawn from the multifaceted history of Bellevue. The hotel's location on Lake Washington was the genesis, beginning with the concept of a “virtual lake house”; a modernist's club house for a creative culture filled with music, fashion and design.
As the project's architect and interior designer, HKS artfully knitted the region's past with its current tech innovation renown as the hotel guest's journey is a slow reveal of discovery, like tales told around the campfire, and memories captured in old family photos.
Within the lake house archetype framework, the Bellevue narrative is found in vivid visual and textural references to the wilderness, rugged individualists, Japanese strawberry farms, summer vacations at the lake, and suburbia.
The interior is a high/low extravaganza of color and pattern, like the lake house repository of a family's cast-off treasures or the garage band's flop house, all with a technical, modern twist.
The W Hotel is part of the 1.5 million square-foot mixed-use Lincoln Square Expansion project in Bellevue's Eastside community.

Kachumbala Maternity Unit,Architecture/Sustainable Design,Dallas/London,"Kachumbala is an impoverished rural area in eastern Uganda with limited access to health care and a high infant mortality rate. Its outdated, two-room, 1950s-era maternity unit could not accommodate nearly half of the women who travel long distances to the facility to give birth. Instead, many women choose to stay home and give birth without medical assistance, increasing the risk of infant and maternal deaths due to infection or birthing complications. Designers were challenged to create a modern maternity unit that would be welcoming and able to handle multiple births every day.
The passively-designed unit houses two delivery suites and a seven-bed postnatal ward to accommodate a minimum of six births per day, with the flexibility to support future expansion. The design was evaluated by UK-based health professionals, who also provided training for the maternity unit's midwives. The low-cost facility was built with the help of a locally-sourced workforce – about 40 people &#8211; and 95 percent of the building materials were locally produced. Sustainable, passive features are design musts in locations where the power supply isn’t reliable and natural resources are scarce. A mono-pitch roof, strategic placement of operable windows, dog runs, &amp; exterior corridors featuring terra cotta screens, create ventilation and shading. The predominant building material, interlocking soil-stabilized blocks were handmade onsite, using locally arising murrum mixed with cement in a brick press, reducing both costs and the need for power tools. HKS partnered with Wales-based charity Engineers for Overseas Development and Clyfe Building Skills to design, fund and build the new maternity unit.

Mosaic Stadium,Architecture/Interior Design/Branded Experiences/Urban Design/Alternative Project Delivery,Dallas,"To be representative of the culture, the history of the region and the people of the region within a package that is responsive to its challenging climate. To shield from the elements while simultaneously welcoming the community and connecting underutilized existing assets within the city's future urban revitalization plan.
Mosaic Stadium's design is characterized by its reflection of the province and its people. The stadium's roof design grew out of fluid dynamic modeling combined with the embodiment of the province's renowned, open sky. Both the design of the roof form and the location of building massing were sculpted to shield fans and players from the prevailing northern winter winds and to shed snow accumulations. The playing surface was set below grade to aid both the climatic response as well as the visual impact to the surrounding developments. Regional and contextual materials take inspiration from both the agricultural heritage at the heart of the region as well as stone native to the area's geology. The flow and the texture of the fields when combined with the aura of the northern lights as seen in the region provided powerful visual cues that informed and enriched the contextuality of the project. Within the framework of the city of Regina's urban revitalization plan, Mosaic Stadium is both an integral component and a foundational element. Surrounding entry plazas and corresponding view corridors were carefully conceived to maximize connections to both the adjacent Evraz Place development, the existing Confederation Park, as well as the planned linear park that physically links the stadium to the city's greater master plan. HKS worked on the project in conjunction with B+H Architects and TD Securities.

Loma de Vida Spa &amp; Wellness at La Cantera Resort,Architecture,Dallas,"Located on the skirts of the existing resort, the layout of the spa became an opportunity to address a difficult sloping site constrained on three sides by the natural and existing conditions of the site. On the backside, a 30-foot-tall boulder wall created a natural visual barrier but a challenging construction site. On the down hillside, the Hole No.1 tee boxes from the golf course created interesting relationships with the future spa guests and the players at the golf course. With a name that means “Hill of Life,” this urban resort sought to bring a sense of rejuvenation and serenity just beyond the attractions of San Antonio.
To avoid creating heavy structures that would create more harm to the site than good, the design team decided to break the mold of the existing architecture style and proposed an alternative modern design approach to the project. This allowed the team to create a modern and contemporary steel building that could cantilever and span across the rugged terrain while creating dramatic volumetric shapes and vistas to the guests through large windows and open-air decks. Glass, steel and wood became the initial design palette. Lifting the structures also allowed the spa guests to have enough separation from more active areas of the resort such as the golf players and vehicular noise from the porte cochere above. Using vernacular traditions, local materials, spa treatments, and a sense of openness, Loma de Vida spa creates a destination in stark contrast to the traditional resort setting. Complete with sky lofts, private soaking pools, and private decks, the spa's clean lines, glass walls and steel frames offer a contemporary setting for relaxation overlooking the expansive landscape.
The partee of the project, which was unveiled in 2015, allowed the resort to reposition itself as one of the leading destinations in the Texas Hill Country region.

The Ohio State University North Residential District Transformation,Mixed-Use/Architecture/Interior Design/Sustainable Design/Alternative Project Delivery,Dallas/Miami,"HKS was challenged to satisfy the gargantuan need for additional residence halls and accompanying infrastructure and facilities since Ohio State University now requires sophomores to live on campus. The project had to be accomplished while classes are in session. The HKS Team was chosen after an intense competitive review process, during which the team identified $26 million in savings to the university.
The North Residential District Transformation project consists of 11 new buildings and the addition of new entries to three existing residential towers with the goal of creating distinct centers of activity for the students, defining the district's edge and establishing the new North Campus Gateway. The design delivers high-quality, efficient residential facilities that will enhance the student experience on campus. Ohio State's “Live Learn” initiative, the Second-year Transformational Experience Program (STEP), focuses on enhancing the education of students beyond the classroom. This program creates a unique living environment designed to incorporate the elements of student success, programmatic needs, architectural innovation and student and faculty interaction. Design elements include ground-floor transparency and ambient light to create a safer environment for pedestrians and encourage interior and exterior activity spaces. Residences are located on upper floors, while ground floors are dedicated to common and STEP spaces, creating controlled access to support security, highlight neighborhood activities and provide live-learn areas for student and faculty interaction. Students are encouraged to leave their “no-frills” dorms and socialize by the juxtaposed engaging common areas. The recreation center was designed by HKS with the intention and ability to eventually expand the building and enclose the play courts. It features a three-story atrium, open stairs, full glazed facade, open gym, exterior play courts and several multipurpose rooms. In addition, a 32,000 square-foot, all-you-can-eat dining hall will seat 950 and a 12,000 square-foot retail market diner will seat 180. This project is seeking LEED Silver certification.
Research shows that students succeed socially and academically when they interact with each other as the design of this project encourages with engaging social areas. It's one reason why these new residential halls are the most popular on campus, where about 34 percent of Ohio State's more than 45,000 students live.","1,100,390 total square feet

"Esperanza, An Auberge Resort",Interior Design/Architecture,Dallas/Mexico City,"After Esperanza suffered severe damage from Hurricane Odile in 2014, HKS was tasked with renovating the beloved Los Cabos seaside resort in just six months. But beyond a simple refresh, the design team's redesign transformed the resort by uniting two key elements – color and culture – that combined the resort's natural cliffside setting with Mexico's rich artisanal heritage.
Incorporating millwork, furniture, lighting, accessories and textiles, all custom-designed and crafted in Mexico, gave Esperanza – which means “hope” in Spanish – a new beginning infused with artistry and romance. Set on a natural backdrop of vivid sunsets and deep sapphire blue waters, Esperanza's contemporary approach melds shades of natural gray, faded blue and white to offer a calming and inviting space for guests. They can retreat into sophisticated and intimate oasis spaces that complement the innate beauty of the surrounding landscape of beaches and rocky cliffs overlooking the Sea of Cortez. An abbreviated design and construction schedule combined with a desire to put people back to work, led HKS to assemble a team of experts well-versed in Mexican culture and resources to identify local fabricators and artisans who could deliver exquisite custom designs on a compressed schedule. Designers lived on-site to expedite purchasing and design details.
HKS took an iconic resort property and breathed new life into its design while remaining true to the spirit that has engendered a devoted guest following, evoking an exclusive yet barefoot-chic seaside sanctuary. It is the only private beach resort in Los Cabos.","51 reimagined guestrooms and suites

U.S. Bank Stadium,Architecture/Interior Design/Urban Design/Sustainable Design/Branded Experiences/LINE,Dallas/Los Angeles,"To create a stadium that connects and celebrates the people of Minnesota, offering an unparalleled fan experience inside the stadium while driving economic development in the surrounding neighborhood.
Home to the Minnesota Vikings NFL team, U.S. Bank Stadium is a multi-purpose venue known as “The People's Stadium.” HKS designed the building to reflect the culture, climate and context of the city, drawing inspiration from ice formations on nearby St. Anthony's Falls as well as Scandinavian design such as Viking longboats. The stadium provides Minneapolis with a year-round venue for concerts, baseball, high school and college athletics, conventions, festivals and more, driving economic and real estate development in the city. Two of the stadium's notable design innovations include The Legacy Gate, comprised of five, pivoting glass doors ranging from 75 to 95 feet tall, and the first ETFE roof in a U.S. stadium. When open, The Legacy Gate connects the stadium to its adjacent urban plaza. The translucent ETFE roof withstands the brutal weather of Minneapolis’ climate, while flooding the interior with natural daylight, creating the feeling of being outdoors without subjecting players or fans to the elements.
Since U.S. Bank Stadium opened in 2016, more than $2 billion in private and public investment has been injected into its surrounding neighborhood, according to Minneapolis’ East Town Business Partnership. In 2018, U.S. Bank Stadium hosted Super Bowl LII and in 2019, it will host the NCAA Final Four.","1.8 million square feet

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Master Site &amp; Facilities Plan,Urban Design/Architecture/Advisory Services,Dallas/New York,"St. Jude sought to create an unparalleled health care campus where children and their families can be comfortable and safe. HKS designers were challenged to maintain a feeling of intimate care and safety on campus as growth occurs and density increases.
We created a plan that manages growth for the campus over the next 10 years, including an additional 3 million square feet of research, clinical and administration space. The plan organizes the site to improve circulation, wayfinding and the overall experience of the campus. HKS worked with St. Jude's leadership to develop a campus vision that connects existing buildings and accommodates significant growth. Sheltered walks reach from one end of the campus to the other. The program features expanded health care services, patient and family housing, research labs, philanthropy facilities and administrative space as well as a visitor center. The plan also considers how to better connect the existing campus with downtown Memphis to support community revitalization and growth.
In the plan, pedestrians take priority. Families and children no longer walk across parking lots to get to medical services. Cars and service vehicles have limited travel lanes as well as better parking and routes that are separated from pedestrian areas. The next generation of buildings are planned to fill in areas of the campus. The result is a unified composition that redefines the open space system and strengthens the campus identity.",,
Rice University Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center,Architecture/Branded Experiences/Interior Design,Dallas/Houston,"HKS was tasked with designing a sports performance center in the north end zone of Rice Stadium that will allow the university to remain a preferred venue for college football and to attract and train top-tier talent.
HKS worked with our partners, Jackson &#038; Ryan, to design a two-story end zone building, including environmental graphics and a new LED scoreboard. In a nod to the elegant lines of the stadium, white columns support the building&#8217;s winged roof, an homage to the school's mascot, the owl. The winged roof projects over an expansive glass wall, providing natural light and a view from the two-story weight room to the stadium and the field. The building features football team locker rooms, strength and conditioning rooms, a 150-seat auditorium and coaches’ offices.
The project has been a tremendous success to the football program for recruiting and player development. According to Coach David Bailiff, the new building has “created a sense of good mental health.” Designed with the needs of students in mind, the enhanced sports medicine and training areas are key to keeping student athletes healthy.","60,000 square feet

McKay-Dee Hospital Center,Architecture/Structural Engineering/Interior Design/Sustainable Design/Advisory Services,Dallas/Denver/Salt Lake City,"To design a hospital that is prepared for growth while incorporating the surrounding environment as a healing element.
Buildings were organized to allow for independent growth of each of the three major components: the inpatient care tower, the ancillary services building and the physicians’ office environment. HKS designers planned the facility horizontally by clinical specialty for clear patient wayfinding and convenient physician circulation. Windows provide views to the mountains and gardens. Most waiting areas open onto the atrium creating a relaxed uplifting environment and giving family members a choice to move about without becoming disoriented.
Working in conjunction with our partners, Architectural Design West, we provided opportunity for immediate incremental growth for high-volume departments such as emergency, obstetrics and heart services. We also designed the building so that it allows for imaging, surgery and the laboratory to double in size with minimum disturbance.
McKay-Dee has been cited among the 10 most beautiful health care environments in the U.S. Its immediate success in the early 2000s is complemented by subsequent growth to expand physician office space by 50 percent and increase in beds by 15 percent.","705,000 square feet

True Worth Place represents a new approach to supporting the homeless. The environment feels more like a hotel or health club, with a central two-story hearth surrounded by club chairs and an exposed wood ceiling. The homeless can eat, take cooking classes, check e-mail or apply for jobs online, receive mail, shower, do laundry, charge electronics, take classes and even access health care in a single facility.
Several interior glass walls provide a sense of safety and openness through clear sight lines, while filling the space with daylight. The site features a community courtyard and outdoor dining on a roof deck with a beautiful view of Fort Worth. An industrial-grade kitchen provides 200 meals each at breakfast and lunch every day.

Carl R Darnall Army Medical Center Replacement Hospital,Architecture/Interior Design/Sustainable Design/Advisory Services,Dallas/Fort Worth,"After opening in 1965, a mid-2000s expansion of the original Carl R Darnall Army Medical Center attempted to satisfy modern health care but the project was riddled with compromises that created a disjointed experience. The army required a brand-new facility with expanded services that would meet the Department of Defense's standards for care at the largest U.S. military base in the world.
Circulation is a central design theme, with a concourse running the length of the facility that provides a clear, orienting element. The functional groupings of services are efficiently organized into “portals of care” that maximize patient-centered care. The exterior design is simple and appealing – promoting efficiency and establishing a desirable healing environment. Texas limestone and precast insulated panels incorporating thin brick provide a cost-effective and appealing façade. External sunshades and high-performance glazing maximize daylighting while minimizing glare, internal heat load and artificial lighting. The design-build team fast tracked design for efficient procurements by working in a highly integrated manner. Off-site manufacturing of modularized, pre-assembled engineering systems was utilized to include RFID tagging for constant monitoring and just-in-time delivery to the construction site. The LEED Gold certified facility also meets the low impact design requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act, and features a 100 percent outside-air mechanical system, high-performance building envelope and rooftop gardens. Construction used recycled materials for more than 30 percent of the project, and local materials for 57 percent.
HKS designed the $534 million medical center to reinforce and promote the mission of Fort Hood medical care by providing world-class health care within a modern healing environment. The hospital demonstrates Fort Hood pride by reflecting local geographical features such as topography, natural materials, rock formations, plateaus and ridges, wetlands and lakes, vegetation and wooded areas. The 615,000-square-foot, 6-story, 122-bed hospital includes an emergency department, diagnostic imaging and surgical services for trauma, general surgery, orthopedic and cesarean sections. Inpatient care includes medical/surgical, ICU, psychiatric care, women's labor, delivery and care, post-partum and a NICU. The 322,000-square-foot, 3-story clinic services building contains primary care, orthopedics, disability evaluation and surgery, rehabilitation, women's services, emergency medicine and behavioral health.","72-acre site

JW Marriott Austin,Architecture/Sustainable Design,Dallas,"To craft an authentic experience that embodies Austin's  spirit and eclectic nature, reinterpreted in a modern and vibrant way. Designers looked to harness the city's energy and strong sense of community to offer guests and locals alike a place to connect and socialize.
The building's exterior brings natural elements from the surrounding rugged Austin landscape into the urban environment in a composition of rich building materials that contrast the typical commercial architecture surrounding the site. Texas limestone, weathered materials such as copper and zinc from the indigenous Texas landscape, links the hotel to Austin's natural beauty.
The JW Marriott offers visitors a true luxury destination, ideally situated within walking distance of the Austin Convention Center, while giving locals and visitors a common playground that unifies Austin's diverse population. One such place is the JW's roof-top pool and bar, with its dramatic city skyline views to the Colorado River and state capitol dome at the end of Congress Avenue.
With a distinct and bold architectural expression, this urban resort highlights the unique character and culture of a special city. Deep thought and attention went into designing the three primary streets intersecting the site to activate the hotel's street edge, creating a warm and welcome feel for guests and locals who live and work downtown. Austin's food truck culture inspired one such street corner: the hotel's Burger Bar transforms how locals engage with the area on a daily basis, and the outdoor Corner Bar creates an energetic outdoor experience that is welcoming for both hotel guests and locals.
Designed to be much more than just an urban convention hotel, the JW Marriott Austin has become a gathering place, reinforcing the city's urban edge while connecting with local residents and visitors alike. Unique architectural facades and active street-level programming strengthen the livability and walkability of the neighborhood.","1,012 luxury guest rooms and suites

DM Aster Med City,Architecture/Interior Design/Urban Design,New Delhi/Dallas/Singapore,"In a region already recognized worldwide as a destination for Ayurvedic wellness, how might a new urban complex located on a tranquil backwater push innovation in health forward, while maintaining a holistic philosophy?
More than a hospital, DM Aster MedCity is an entire urban development dedicated to healing. The plan, inspired by the nesting behaviors of the local Brahminy Kite, resembles a family of birds settled along the banks of the Kochi backwaters. Built on a 38-acre property, the 600,000 square foot, eight-story medical building is strategically situated to provide optimal views and offer opportunities for vertical and horizontal expansion. Three inpatient bed towers are united by a central atrium at the base of the building, which is surrounded by pedestrian circulation paths that take the healing experience outdoors. In addition to patient care, MedCity also includes a 4-star hotel and serviced apartments, a 500-seat convention center, retail, staff accommodations and high-end residential units to create a sustainable and active community for some 10,000 residents. HKS collaborated on this project with Design Relations in Kochi.
Since opening in May 2015, DM Aster Med City has provided a sustainable model for impacting medical research in the country and beyond, and is equipped to offer the best medical services in India to patients with advanced diseases.

As the organization evolved to meet changing research needs and accelerating technology, they outgrew traditional biosecurity standards and the HKS team was asked to design a building that provides a highly-controlled environment that meets strict international regulations.
Situated on a landscaped central plaza and connected to the rest of the campus via a covered walkway, the laboratory building creates a new focal point for researchers and visitors alike. With a glass curtain wall façade clad by a corten steel screen, this six-story, 183,000 square foot building houses Mexico's Center for Disease Control, multiple labs for the containment and study of infectious diseases and a vivarium facility.

Urumqi International Airport North Terminal,Architecture,Dallas/Shanghai,"This international airport is situated at the historical crossroads of East and West, both physically and conceptually. Design competitors were challenged to incorporate the intertwined cultures and histories of China's centuries-old Silk Road region into an airport for the new millennium.
Created with Pascall+Watson, this concept for a 4.3 million square foot airport terminal draws upon influences from the cultures, history and topography of central Asia and China's Silk Road. The Silk Road, a 4,000-mile network of interlinking trade routes forming an historical connection and continuous journey between Asia and Europe, is an appropriate precedent for the creation of a new world hub airport. The region's rugged mountains and desert dunes come to life in the terminal's undulating form, while patterns, colors and textures of traditional silks and other textiles are reflected in the building materials and suggest the movement of fabric in the wind. The architectural expression of these inspirational elements, combined with the efficiency, flexibility, connectivity and high quality passenger service of a modern airport terminal, create a new architectural gateway for Urumqi's “continuous journey” into the future.
Urumqi International Airport serves not only as a gateway between East and West, but as a sign of Xinjiang's ongoing significance in the economic and social landscape of modern China. In the context of the world's great airports, Urumqi's aspiration to grow this new development up to 44 million passengers per year or more heralds the region's growing presence on the world stage.","International design competition

The design melds old and new in a clean, modern glass expression that respectfully contrasts the existing brickwork, gabled front and masonry walls, while keeping the industrial feel of the former electric company warehouse. The street façade of the live/work units on the ground floor and main entrance with large glass openings that carry the glass expression down from above further integrates the buildings’ historic elements with the contemporary look that feels completely at home in San Francisco's South End Historic District.

University of North Texas Apogee Stadium,Architecture/Branded Experiences/Interior Design/Sustainable Design,Dallas,"The University of North Texas challenged HKS to design a facility that would be the most sustainably designed stadium in the country while serving as a revenue-generating facility for its university.
Providing the entire North Texas region with a venue for a variety of outdoor events from college football to high school band competitions, the new stadium is nestled into the contoured sloping terrain. HKS designers preserved a grove of Post Oak trees and respected the natural, open character of the site. The stadium grounds have a campus feel, which was an element of the University Master Plan. A natural amphitheater and areas for tailgating, picnics and pregame festivals surround the stadium and integrate game day celebrations into the action. 
The stadium circulation follows the sloping site descending from east to west through plazas, special event areas and concourses. The stadium features state-of-the-art high-efficiency mechanical systems, water-efficient plumbing, regionally obtained materials and permeable paving.

Salt River Fields at Talking Stick,Architecture/Branded Experiences/Interior Design/Sustainable Design/Structural Engineering/Urban Design,Dallas/Phoenix,"To create the ultimate baseball destination environment, designed to encourage unprecedented fan interactions and support the interests of the community beyond baseball.
Widely regarded as Major League Baseball's (MLB) top Spring Training facility, Salt River Fields is surrounded by some of the most beautiful mountain views in baseball. The overall site offers an immersive fan experience for fans of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies, who occupy clubhouses around the field. The design is inspired by traditional native dwellings situated around a central courtyard. Radiating from this central courtyard, support buildings, practice fields and clubhouses form an overall cohesive complex. The wall of one space becomes the boundary of a field or the edge of a path. These walls and roofs are built to reference traditional and historic native culture and life. Masonry is used to simply yet eloquently serve as a backdrop to the landscaping and playing fields. Inside the stadium, the detailing is carefully designed to reveal concessions and fan support amenities. Collectively, the walls, the openings and the pathways ultimately serve multiple purposes: to promote interaction of fans and players, to frame key views of the surrounding landscape and to encourage environmental awareness and stewardship.
The first professional sports venue built on Native American land, Salt River Fields at Talking Stick blends environmental stewardship and innovation with ancestral custom. Named the first LEED Gold certified sports venue of its kind, the stadium features stone materials from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community lands and is surrounded by landscaped grounds that include more than 85 replanted trees and cacti. Today's spring training facilities need to be a community resource beyond just baseball, and Salt River Fields was the first to truly break the mold by incorporating successful community events outside the daily or annual MLB operations. Since opening, Salt River Fields has become a premier location for event planners and promoters including annual food and beverage events, music festivals, community festivals and local sports.",,
Phoenix Children’s Hospital,Architecture/Interior Design/Advisory Services/Structural Engineering,Dallas/Phoenix,"Recognizing that a child patient's care team consists of not only health care professionals, but also the child&#8217;s family, Phoenix Children's Hospital challenged the design team to improve the existing campus design and create a space that encourages and accommodates families, allowing them to take on more active roles.
We responded to the challenge by creating a welcoming oasis that provides shade and healing while emulating the natural beauty of the surrounding mountains and desert. The visual impact on the community is striking, creating the desired “wow-factor” for the campus while providing stunning views of the entire valley, mountains and city skyline from private patient rooms. To support the hospital's mission of treating the entire family and not just the patient, care was taken to improve the patient/family journey from the moment they step onto the campus and experience the whimsical and lush landscaping, accented by bold colors, playful sculpture and indigenous plant material. The dramatic three-story atrium welcomes visitors in a shaded glass sanctuary. The facility utilizes indigenous color, playful animal sculpture and desert flowers to organize each floor vertically. Strategic daylighting promotes calm within spaces that punctuate corridors, and create painted vistas within individual rooms. The team created thoughtful experiences and spaces around patient/family and caregiver functions, knitting them together to form a cohesive, integrated whole.
Phoenix Children's Hospital's planned addition and renovations support the mission and vision to position the facility as one of the largest pediatric campuses in the country while offering an inspiring and comforting atmosphere. Winner of a Modern Healthcare built design award, this 770,000 square foot hospital is sensitive to its harsh environment. Designers adhered to the Green Guide for Health Care and made use of 3D simulations to develop a functional tower that maximizes daylight potential, creates shading opportunities for courtyards while minimizing heat gain. Local materials and playful biophilic environmental graphics abound in a colorful celebration of nature and local culture.","770,000 square feet

Tah.Mah.Lah. Residence,Architecture/Sustainable Design,Dallas/San Francisco,"To design a residential home that would be 100 percent sustainable for generations to come and seamlessly integrate into its ecosystem, producing more energy than it consumes, restoring habitat, saving and repurposing water and reusing waste.
Built with reclaimed wood, glass, metal and stone and fully solar-powered, the 5,600 square-foot Tah.Mah.Lah. eliminated its own and its occupants’ total carbon footprint, including transportation. All water used at the site is recycled or repurposed and a high-efficiency irrigation system uses harvested rainwater and treated black/grey water with the help of a 50,000-gallon underground cistern. The design solution centered on all four areas of sustainable and regenerative building: energy, materials, water and habitat, delivered by a team of more than four dozen project consultants and artists, wastewater system engineers, energy specialists and wildlife biologists, collaborating in a fully integrated design process incorporating the owners’ lifestyle and green goals.
Tah.Mah.Lah. achieved USGBC LEED for Homes Platinum certification; with the homes’ innovation credits, it is the greenest custom home in the United States. It's also a demonstration project, serving as an inspiration and educational place to share knowledge and build green, helping create a market for green ideas, goods, services and jobs. Since July 2011, Tah.Mah.Lah. has hosted numerous groups and tours – Stanford University students, USGBC Greenbuild Conference tours, and Bay Area Peninsula mayors who discussed ways to create sustainable cities.",,
Washington Headquarters Services,Interior Design/Architecture,"Dallas/Richmond/Washington, D.C.","HKS was awarded the contract for this design-build, mega-project more than a year after all previous Base Realignment and Closure projects, but it shared the same fixed completion date of Sept. 15, 2011. That meant the project team faced the steep challenge of designing, constructing and delivering nearly 2 million square feet of secure office space for Department of Defense agencies within 33 months.
Located at Mark Center, the Washington Headquarters Services complex is part of a 350-acre mixed-use campus in Alexandria, Virginia, 4 miles from the Pentagon. The project consists of all new, class A construction that allows for spacious nine-foot-four-inch ceilings in an open office environment. The buildings are modern and progressive in character, and a rich architectural precast and glass skin represents strength, stability and progressiveness. The complex is notable for its spectacular views of both Washington, D.C. and its natural campus setting. The building's technology was futureproofed as much as possible while providing major increases in efficiency. Energy saving features include occupancy sensors, a high-efficiency central chiller plant, demand-controlled ventilation and a dedicated outdoor air system with energy recovery wheels. LED lighting fixtures throughout the facility contribute significantly to a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. Careful selection of low-flow faucets, shower heads and plumbing fixtures, along with zero-irrigation and drought-tolerant landscaping, reduces potable water usage by 45 percent. The project design also maximizes the use of visible green elements, including green roof designs for the Visitor's Center and Remote Inspection Facility, a bioswale for filtering stormwater runoff, and an extensive green screen that wraps the façade of one of the parking structures. To reduce transit emissions, the project features its own transportation center and limited on-site parking for about 60 percent of the overall population.
Washington Headquarters Services is considered a ‘mini-Pentagon,” or annex to the Pentagon. The $953 million Washington Headquarters Services houses more than 6,400 employees from 26 agencies and 170 sub-agencies in a 1.8 million-square-foot complex. Using a unique design-build process, the 30-month construction schedule was completed five weeks early and more than $50 million under budget. This is the first U.S. Army Corps project of this size to earn LEED Gold certification. Using modern strategies in environmentally sustainable construction and site development, the project mitigates its overall environmental impact by enabling energy efficiency, water savings, indoor environmental quality and sustainable site design. During construction, waste recycling practices diverted an estimated 6 million pounds of potable construction waste from landfills.","350-acre site

Ahuja Medical Center's modern exterior acknowledges the growing community it serves, particularly baby-boomers living in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland. It is organized around a flexible strategy for growth that allows the public and service spines to expand incrementally, with the ability to expand from its initial 144 beds up to 600 beds.
A seven-story, curved tower is easily visible from the freeway, while internal views frame adjoining wetlands. Inside, the hospital embraces a “community of care” philosophy, promoting the welfare of both patients and staff through improved efficiencies and safety.
Working with an art curator, HKS designers meticulously planned the installation of 250 original works of art, transcending patient-focused care to create “guest-focused care.”
With lots of natural light and materials, the hospital brings the outside in and makes it one with its natural surroundings. The facility incorporates the site's wetlands, bio swales and native plants. In addition, the bed tower is designed to take maximum advantage of passive solar energy.","375,000 square feet

University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Alkek Tower Expansion,Architecture/Interior Design/Advisory Services,Dallas/Houston,"To add 12 stories to an existing high-rise hospital without distractions for patients, families and hospital staff, while accommodating different hospital programming needs than when HKS designed the original building in the 1990s.
Even though HKS designed the original hospital with infrastructure for expansion, health care practices and technology had changed greatly in almost 20 years. For the expansion, we increased the building's footprint by cantilevering over the corners of the existing building, allowing space for bigger patient rooms that are on average 40 square feet larger than those below. We then added cantilevering on both sides of the rear staff corridor to add four patient rooms for a total of 48 beds on each patient floor. 
To address the challenge of having construction proceed atop an existing structure without creating distractions for patients their families and staff, a mechanical floor was created between the existing and new building to facilitate building systems operations and create a buffer between the upper and lower floors.
Finding a lighter exterior façade material that was an exact match to the existing exterior façade posed an interesting design dilemma. Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete (GFRC) was the answer. GFRC, a precast system, creates a 1- to 1 ½-inch thick façade – versus the traditionally 7- to 9-inch precast concrete system – allowing less weight to be attached to the vertical structure. This enabled the team to add two more floors to the building.","500,000 square feet of new space

AT&amp;T Stadium,Architecture/Urban Design/Interior Design/Branded Experiences,Dallas,"To craft a stadium that creatively embodies the proud history of the Dallas Cowboys while simultaneously giving the franchise the indelible look of the future.
Since its founding in 1960, the Dallas Cowboys have become one of the world's most renowned professional sports franchises. Nicknamed “America's Team,” the Cowboys’ former stadium was known for its iconic Ring of Honor and “hole” in the middle of the roof. Forward-thinking HKS architects incorporated those brand features into the Cowboys new home, AT&amp;T Stadium, designing a retractable roof and prominent interior space to honor stars of the past. But the stadium design also steps into the future with plush stadium seats and luxury boxes located at field level to enhance the stadium's 5-Star hotel feel. In addition, canted 800-foot glass walls span the length of the stadium and two powerful steel arches – the longest single-span arches in the world – support the structure's interior while framing its two end zone entry plazas.
AT&amp;T Stadium is more than simply a showcase for the Dallas Cowboys. It redefined what fans expect from an NFL gameday experience. It has the world's largest jumbotron, art worthy of a modern art museum, clubs and experiences that reset the benchmark for professional football fan experiences. AT&amp;T Stadium has hosted the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Super Bowl XLV in 2010, and the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. Beyond sporting events, the stadium hosts concerts ranging from U2 to Beyonce.",,

Lucas Oil Stadium,Architecture/Branded Experiences/Interior Design/Urban Design,Dallas,"HKS designers were challenged to design a multipurpose event facility filled with modern-day amenities and capabilities while maintaining the timeless, rustic look and feel of the Midwestern state the stadium calls home.
Drawing on architectural energy from the city's and state's rich heritage, the Lucas Oil Stadium design conjures a turn-of-the-century look for one of the most distinctive, multi-use mega-venues in the United States. The design incorporates many elements unique to Indiana and its history as a sports powerhouse. The brick, steel and glass structure reflect the traditional forms and historical feel of the state's venerable collegiate and high school basketball arenas and collegiate football stadiums. From an architectural standpoint, the facility is noteworthy for its retractable roof and seating bowl configuration that accentuate its distinct look and enhance its function. Huge retractable windows at the stadium's northeast side provide guests with a clear view of the Indianapolis skyline, a view enhanced by the designers’ decision to place the structure at an angle on the property toward the radial city center of Indianapolis. With the Indianapolis Convention Center just across the railroad tracks, HKS designed a unique 25-foot, clear-of-structure exhibit hall expansion hall on the north end of the stadium with removable/retractable seats allowing the stadium floor to become another 145,000 square-foot exhibit hall to compliment the convention center complex complete with convention floor boxes at 60 foot centers each way for utility services.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Rental Car Center,Architecture/Alternative Project Delivery,Dallas/Phoenix,"HKS was tasked with creating a consolidated car rental facility (CONRAC), at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. With sustainability and a convenient, seamless experience in mind, the facility needed to bring 16 different car agencies under a single roof to better serve the third-largest car rental market in the United States.
Customer-facing services are each housed in separate bays of a grand 150,000 square foot customer service building that consolidates storage and back-of-house services in a 7,200-space, multi-level rental car facility.
Open space abounds, allowing for lines to form and for large groups to congregate, giving the lobby the feeling of a small airport.

DFW International Airport Terminal D,Architecture/Branded Experiences/Urban Design,Dallas,"To position DFW International Airport as a leading international airport by creating a Dallas/Fort Worth-branded terminal with modern amenities and flexibility to accommodate future technologies and concessions offerings.
In one of the industry's first &#8220;Big Rooms,&#8221; the entire project team worked collaboratively to design a terminal that would evolve and adapt to needs, trends and regulations over time. 
The 2.1 million-square-foot, $1.2 billion DFW International Airport Terminal D program opened in 2005 as one of the first newly constructed terminals after September 11th. Yet passengers don&#8217;t notice the embedded security features that address post-9/11 security requirements because they&#8217;re seamlessly integrated into the design.
The designers went even further with Terminal D by ensuring it remained responsive and anticipatory to industry changes, additions and adaptations, allowing the terminal to remain at the fore of responsive aviation design.
Terminal D conveys a timeless environment and regional gateway that is adaptable to the constantly changing demands of revenue development and new technologies.  HKS, as managing architect and design collaborator, was responsible for the overall execution of the project which included the terminal with retail, national and regional food and beverage offerings; premium lounges; a fully-integrated Grand Hyatt hotel and a new central utility plant, an 8,100-car parking garage, a connecting Skybridge to Terminal C and roadway improvements.

Parker Adventist Hospital,Architecture/Interior Design/Structural Engineering/Advisory Services,Dallas,"Population growth drove the need for a full-service acute care facility, while the context of the surrounding mountains set the scene for more inviting and natural elements. The HKS design team was tasked with striking a balance between the need for technical and patient space, and the community's desire for connection with the outdoors.
A lodge-like design mirrors the majestic mountains of Colorado. Three story chimneys and large and locally-sourced wood and stone finishes reflect an emphasis on verticality and scale and offer spacious and non-institutional atmosphere for this growing community.
The exterior and interior materials selection and design elements exemplify local vernaculars. The ideas of the mountains being majestic and stable inspired the team to explore an entry element that accentuated vertically.
The hospital offers emergency/trauma care, cardiac services, surgical services, intensive care, diagnostic imaging, a birthing center with NICU and a partnership with The Children's Hospital for specialized pediatric care.
The design accommodates more growth by keeping administrative functions in an adjacent 85,000 square foot medical office building. Flexibly planned medical facilities allow for departmental shifts to occur without disrupting the day-to-day care of patients. The patient wing is configured so that 75 percent of the rooms have views of prominent mountain peaks.
