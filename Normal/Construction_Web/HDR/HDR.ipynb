The program focuses on four components: Eat Well, Move Well, Feel Well, and Be Well.\\nSeveral steps were taken to ensure the program was enabled through design by improving the ability to move physically throughout the campus. A walking path extends around the campus with greenery and markers that detail travel distances to desired locations.

In response to increased demand and changing community needs, DRMC set the course for an expansion of the facility and the implementation of new healthcare technologies to continue its mission to serve the surrounding population from its dramatic site among the Red Cliffs of St. George, Utah.\\nThe people of St. George are very active in the surrounding landscape of mountains, cliffs, rivers and trails. Inspired by the striation cut into the cliffs by the Virgin River, elements of nature were assigned to each of the five levels, starting with pebbles of the riverbed on the lower level, then river and water, followed by trail at the next level, then rock layers that make the cliffs of the riverside, and finally waterfall at the top level, reflecting the local environment within the facility.\\nOur design team reimagined an approach to campus growth that capitalized on what patients and visitors already loved about DRMC — its small scale and easy wayfinding. Two campuses were consolidated into the new facility at River Road, sized to relocate and expand acute-care services as well as make room for a newly designed Women & Newborn Center.\\nThe DRMC campus transformation is the largest project in southern Utah and not only increases the medical center to a Level II trauma center, but also brings the first integrated MRI to the state of Utah.\\nThe final master plan consisted of two separate bed towers: One at the northwest corner for the Women & Newborn services and another at the southeast corner expanding adult services from the existing bed tower. The Intermountain Cancer Center, designed to place cancer treatment and research under one roof, rests adjacent to the main campus.\\nEvolving the master plan from one large project to three smaller ones allows the existing infrastructure and support services — such as the clinical lab, loading dock and food service — to more seamlessly handle the increased capacity and expanded distribution.\\nNew site developments include increased parking, wellness paths for patients as well as community members, and outdoor dining and recreation spaces — all extending what is already a veritable living museum of trees and plants native to the high desert region.\\nIn this new model, the Women & Newborn Center has developed a distinct identity independent of other service lines. A dedicated entry/drop-off for patients separates these services from the rest of the program, while establishing internal adjacencies such as labor and delivery on the same floor as the NICU, and post-partum care located one floor above.\\nThe interior design creates a calming and user-friendly environment. On-stage/off-stage circulation establishes separate pathways for patient and material flows minimizing noise and eliminating clutter.\\nPatient safety is ensured through decentralized workstations for caregivers which provide high visibility and allow close proximity to patients.

After securing an option to purchase an urban growth area above the flood plain, they brought us on board to conduct a feasibility study and conceptual master plan for infrastructure, land planning and net-zero analysis centered on a stunningly resilient town center surrounded by attainable homes. With leadership from our community designers backed by input from our engineers, environmental scientists, sustainability experts and architects, the outcome is a plan for a triple net-zero community that provides residents an option to affordably move to higher ground.\\nTriple net-zero focuses on achieving net-zero energy, net-zero water and net-zero carbon within a circular economy framework. The feasibility study imagines features like rooftop solar panels for energy, anaerobic bio-digesters to process food waste into fertilizer and a community greenhouse to contribute to the resilient, sustainable approach. Using Hamilton’s rainy climate to support the circular economy, rain and other wastewater could be reclaimed and reused.\\nBy minimizing resource use, the plan for Hamilton improves viability of land development. More than half of the development area is protected as natural land, using design elements that help to recover the ecosystem. The plan maximizes efficiency to make triple net-zero design a feasible part of an affordable housing project.\\nThe sustainable design also protects Hamilton’s neighboring sea life and environment.

Since the 1970s, I-71 has been a major, regional thoroughfare connecting people and freight from the city’s core with its suburbs in Ohio’s southwest corridor. However, this same thoroughfare had separated neighborhoods and limited access to the Uptown area, home to two Level 1 trauma centers, Cincinnati’s second-largest job center and five of the city’s largest employers.\\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation collaborated with city officials to develop a solution that would permanently bring together the Uptown community on both sides of the freeway. Our HDR team led the design for a new, full interchange for traffic on I-71 at Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. In the process, the $80 million project became a catalyst for future economic development and thousands of new jobs in Uptown’s seven Cincinnati neighborhoods.\\nWe teamed up with Kokosing Construction Company in April 2014 to win the design-build contract to construct the interchange, which included four new entrance/exit ramps at a widened MLK Drive, reconstruction of 2 miles of I-71, and work on eight new or rehabilitated bridges. Our HDR team was responsible for the design of bridges, walls, roadway geotechnical elements, traffic signals, intelligent transportation systems, way-finding lighting, aesthetics and maintenance of traffic plans. We also provided a support role for public involvement, environmental policies, right-of-way and document control.\\nBecause of the contractual requirement to break ground by July 2014, delivery speed was vital. In order to meet this first deadline, we had to collaborate effectively with Kokosing and all project stakeholders. We expedited the project design process by dividing the work into 10 buildable units in order to get separate sections of design and construction reviewed and approved quickly. We met the contractual requirement of breaking ground less than three months after award through diligent teamwork and planning with the contractor. The rest of the design work was completed and approved on-time within a year from start to finish.\\nOur HDR team thrived on the challenges of meeting our project timetable. For example, due to the speed at which ODOT procured the DB contract, right-of-way acquisition was still ongoing when construction began. This limited the locations where initial construction could occur, \\xa0which meant the first year of construction was largely work in the interstate right of way.\\nWe developed numerous alternative technical concepts to help control the schedule and costs, including geometric improvements, pavement optimizations and structural innovations like the pre-cast wall panels used only once before on an ODOT project. Additionally, we used a geometric layout called a “combined tight and folded-diamond interchange” to fit the four new MLK Drive ramps, resulting in a smaller footprint and less impact to private property than traditional interchange types. We also realigned and flip-flopped the southbound MLK Drive and WH Taft Road off-ramps at this interchange. The reconfiguration resulted in a more intuitive exit for drivers, improved nighttime lighting conditions, eliminated a bridge span and reduced wall heights which will decrease future maintenance costs.\\nSustainable designs based on community input were essential. We worked with the City of Cincinnati Architect to develop the corridor’s aesthetic features, which included the MLK Interchange’s cable-stay bridge feel and mechanically-stabilized earth wall panel patterns. Local stakeholders chose such features and the color palette — creating the gateway concept into Uptown that the community sought.\\nConstruction was largely complete by the end of the 2017 construction season, and early estimates of time saved with the new MLK Interchange shows the intended result — reduced travel time by up to 8 minutes for drivers headed to the Uptown area. We also helped add more and safer bus stops in the area, along with a 14-foot, multi-use path to increase mobility for transit users and pedestrians.\\nIn short, our comprehensive design was completed on-time and within budget. The project reduces travel times, increases mobility, enhances way-finding and promotes economic vitality. The new interchange improves access to Uptown’s Healthcare District, home to the two trauma centers, University of Cincinnati, Xavier University, the Cincinnati Zoo and many other employers. Looking ahead, the project is expected to bring over 7,000 jobs to the Uptown area and over $700 million in new economic development.\\nLearn more about this award-winning project in our previously published article, “\\nCincinnati’s I-71/MLK Interchange: Improving Access, Building Economic Vitality\\n.”']]\n"
