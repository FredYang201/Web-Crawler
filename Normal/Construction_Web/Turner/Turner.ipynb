The resulting mat foundation is 18 feet thick and weighs more than 82 million pounds.\\n\\nThe Wilshire Grand Center is features a hybrid technology which uses a combination of structural steel, reinforced concrete and what are known as Buckling Restraint Braces (BRB’s) to resist high lateral forces – such as those that act upon a high-rise building in an earthquake. The BRBs absorbs seismic forces and work with what are called belt trusses, which go around the building’s perimeter, to prevent both buckling and twisting under severe ground motion.\\n\\nBuilt offsite, 700 prefabricated bathroom pods were trucked to the site six at a time, hoisted into place, and bolted down the same day. The process saved time, money and trips up and down the hoist with material. In addition to these savings, factory building conditions are safer and more controlled, which facilitates high-quality, consistent work, and is easier on the trade contractors doing the assembly.\\n\\nThe project team at the Wilshire Grand Center earned Golden Gate recognition from Cal/OSHA for their site safety program.\\xa0The Golden Gate partnership recognition program supports and motivates teams that partner pro-actively with the Cal/OSHA Consultation Service on the development of their site-specific safety plans.\\n\\nThe 73-story Wilshire Grand Center is the tallest building in the West, with its iconic curved roof and spire reaching 1,100 feet into the air.\\nEven as we recognize that a finished project is greater than the sum of its parts, as builders, we think the parts are pretty impressive. For example, the Wilshire Grand Center represents the work of more than 2,200 people over 257 weeks, who put in place more than 22,000 tons of steel, more than 55,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 500,000 square feet of glass.

Wal-Mart envisioned an experimental green building that could generate a substantial portion of energy from renewable sources as well as provide a healthy work and shopping environment for its associates and customers.\\n\\nDuring an extensive preconstruction period, Turner collaborated with Wal-Mart and the design team to evaluate a variety of sustainable construction ideas. The team’s research, resulted in a sustainable design that reflects the owner’s expectations for a high-performance building. The facade is broken up by entry vestibules with 35-foot-tall clerestories that rise out of the low roof section, creating light beacons at night to lead customers to the building entries. Green screens on three sides of the garden center, and four facades give the building shade, ventilation, and a living edge. The rear of the building has a solar wall to preheat outside air. The interior of the store benefits from natural daylight from the building entry vestibules, three 450-foot-long north-facing rooftop clerestories, and skylights.

It included seismic upgrade of the entire library building and additions, elevator renovations and the addition of a fire suppression system.

The resulting mat foundation is 18 feet thick and weighs more than 82 million pounds.\\n\\nThe Wilshire Grand Center is features a hybrid technology which uses a combination of structural steel, reinforced concrete and what are known as Buckling Restraint Braces (BRB’s) to resist high lateral forces – such as those that act upon a high-rise building in an earthquake. The BRBs absorbs seismic forces and work with what are called belt trusses, which go around the building’s perimeter, to prevent both buckling and twisting under severe ground motion.\\n\\nBuilt offsite, 700 prefabricated bathroom pods were trucked to the site six at a time, hoisted into place, and bolted down the same day. The process saved time, money and trips up and down the hoist with material. In addition to these savings, factory building conditions are safer and more controlled, which facilitates high-quality, consistent work, and is easier on the trade contractors doing the assembly.\\n\\nThe project team at the Wilshire Grand Center earned Golden Gate recognition from Cal/OSHA for their site safety program.\\xa0The Golden Gate partnership recognition program supports and motivates teams that partner pro-actively with the Cal/OSHA Consultation Service on the development of their site-specific safety plans.\\n\\nThe 73-story Wilshire Grand Center is the tallest building in the West, with its iconic curved roof and spire reaching 1,100 feet into the air.\\nEven as we recognize that a finished project is greater than the sum of its parts, as builders, we think the parts are pretty impressive.
