"Flats East Bank Development consists of a three-story, 545-car parking garage, a 22-story office building complex to house tenants including Ernst & Young, Tucker Ellis & West, CBRE, and a six-story Aloft Hotel. Gilbane’s Cleveland District office is also headquartered in the new tower.  The transit-oriented design connects the public rail system, Waterfront Line, to the complex for easy access to downtown locations and the FirstEnergy Stadium, home of the Cleveland Browns football team.
Gilbane completed extensive preconstruction services which included procurement and diversity outreach, value engineering, constructability reviews, and estimating services. Diverse and small business participation goals were exceeded.
Gilbane directed construction of the Flats East Bank Development on a tight site in an urban environment with many constraints, including adjacent facilities, limited lay-down areas, and a high volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. To manage this complexity, we developed and implemented site-specific Logistics and Traffic Control Plans. To minimize disruptions to the surrounding area, Gilbane constructed a concrete Jersey barrier with a chain link fence around the construction site, and coordinated with adjacent building managers and local authorities regarding all lane closures and changes to traffic flow.
Whenever possible, Gilbane arranged for prefabrication of project components to eliminate much of the on-site work such as welding, reduce the number of workers on site, improve quality, and enhance field safety. Prefabricated items included the unitized curtain wall panels; concrete column reinforcement; large sheet metal ductwork and pipe risers; structural stud framing walls for the hotel; and others. The unitized curtain wall was prefabricated and assembled in Columbia, South America. This required close coordination of material procurement, shipping of glass tiles from the US to Columbia, fabrication, unit assembly, shipping from port to port, trucking to the jobsite, and hoisting to the building floors for installation.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/flats-east-bank-development/,"Client Name: Flats East Bank Development

"If ever a project incorporated multiple varieties of construction with both design and building proceeding at the same time, it is Moody Gardens. This project is a master planned multi-use 250-acre complex, which has been in continuous development for over 20 years. As part of a continuing alliance with Moody Gardens, Gilbane has provided design oversight and construction management services for the complex.
Gilbane has served as the construction manager on all phases of The Moody Gardens Complex. We have faced multiple unique situations with building on Galveston Island and have responded with workable solutions to successfully complete all projects. Such issues include: dealing with precast piles reaching 80’ depth; dewatering systems; building humidity issues; structural fill of 5’ – 7’ per building to raise above the acceptable sea level for flood insurance; water treatment facilities; and assuring wind load testing is performed on critical areas.
Phase III – Included the addition and renovation of the Hope Arena, conference center, pier and dock facility, 100-foot glass pyramid conservatory and tropical rain forest, 400-seat 3D I-Max theatre, visitors center and 300,000 gallon water treatment facility.
Phase IV – Included a new 100-foot glass pyramid housing a state-of-the-art aquarium with four major exhibits and an ocean theatre. The facility has a 1,000,000 gallon and three 250,000 gallon tanks housing hundreds of species of marine life and a new 100-foot glass pyramid discovery museum including a NASA exhibit and three I-Max ride theatres.

"A new General Assembly Office Building (GAB) will be built for the Virginia state legislature, replacing the 420,000 square feet of existing buildings on the corner of Ninth and Broad Streets in downtown Richmond, VA. Before construction began on the new building, the existing buildings underwent hazardous material abatement and demolition. Gilbane was also tasked with several supporting and phased renovations to provide adequate swing space for the General Assembly. Renovations to the Monroe Building, Main Street Center and the Pocahontas building occurred concurrently while portions of the buildings remained occupied. The fast-tracked renovations started in 2016 and were complete before the official groundbreaking of the General Assembly building in August 2017.
The new building’s design will reflect the historic nature of its surroundings in Capital Square, incorporating surrounding architectural elements. To accomplish this, Gilbane is preserving the historic façade throughout construction, and will incorporate it into the new, but classic design. The original six-story 1912 building was built with an elaborate exterior limestone façade that features three-story Corinthian-style pilasters. In October 2017, the team began constructing a temporary steel bracing tower to support the soon freestanding façade. This effort involved the erection of nearly 370 tons of steel columns, beams, outriggers and whalers; as well as the drilling and pouring of three-foot diameter concrete caissons approximately 60 feet below the site. Seismographs to monitor vibrations and anchored survey points were installed to the façade during demolition to ensure the limestone façade did not move during this process. By the end of March 2018, the 105-year-old façade had been cut away and was standing on its own for the first time, protected by an intricate framework of steel.
The new General Assembly Building is currently under construction. It is projected to be complete by 2021. The lower four floors of the 400,000-square-foot building will include various public functions, including committee rooms, a cafeteria and other meeting facilities. Above the fourth floor will be legislator and staff offices and other meeting spaces.

Seismic monitoring was necessary to ensure uninterrupted operation to these businesses.
In order for the Complex to serve as an Emergency Operations Shelter and 911 dispatch center, emergency energy systems were crucial.

"Flats East Bank Development consists of a three-story, 545-car parking garage, a 22-story office building complex to house tenants including Ernst & Young, Tucker Ellis & West, CBRE, and a six-story Aloft Hotel. Gilbane’s Cleveland District office is also headquartered in the new tower.  The transit-oriented design connects the public rail system, Waterfront Line, to the complex for easy access to downtown locations and the FirstEnergy Stadium, home of the Cleveland Browns football team.
Gilbane completed extensive preconstruction services which included procurement and diversity outreach, value engineering, constructability reviews, and estimating services. Diverse and small business participation goals were exceeded.
Gilbane directed construction of the Flats East Bank Development on a tight site in an urban environment with many constraints, including adjacent facilities, limited lay-down areas, and a high volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. To manage this complexity, we developed and implemented site-specific Logistics and Traffic Control Plans. To minimize disruptions to the surrounding area, Gilbane constructed a concrete Jersey barrier with a chain link fence around the construction site, and coordinated with adjacent building managers and local authorities regarding all lane closures and changes to traffic flow.
Whenever possible, Gilbane arranged for prefabrication of project components to eliminate much of the on-site work such as welding, reduce the number of workers on site, improve quality, and enhance field safety. Prefabricated items included the unitized curtain wall panels; concrete column reinforcement; large sheet metal ductwork and pipe risers; structural stud framing walls for the hotel; and others. The unitized curtain wall was prefabricated and assembled in Columbia, South America. This required close coordination of material procurement, shipping of glass tiles from the US to Columbia, fabrication, unit assembly, shipping from port to port, trucking to the jobsite, and hoisting to the building floors for installation.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/flats-east-bank-development/,"Client Name: Flats East Bank Development

"As a result of the devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy, New York City Mayor Bloomberg in partnership with FEMA, launched an unprecedented program to get as many New Yorkers as possible back in their homes as quickly as possible.
The Rapid Repairs Program (RRP) provided immediate and comprehensive assistance to thousands of New York City residents who were displaced and unable to return their homes due to the lack of basic services. The RRP is part of the Sheltering and Temporary Essential Power (STEP) Pilot Program through FEMA to provide essential power to affected communities.

"The Potawatomi Community recognized that adding a hotel to their casino property was key to transforming it into a true regional destination resort. To maximize future development opportunities, the casino is built on Potawatomi’s trust land, and the hotel is constructed on their adjacent non-trust property. Because the hotel site is flanked on two sides by the existing casino, the project team developed a flexible, long-term master plan that connects the hotel and casino through a grand three-story atrium, and in the future the casino can be expanded on the remaining trust land and seamlessly connect to the entire hotel.
The new 19-story, 350,000 SF casino hotel features 381 hotel rooms including 16, two bay suites and one Presidential Suite, 15,000 SF of meeting space to support the recently renovated 32,000 SF Expo Center, an outdoor patio roof deck, a new full service restaurant and kitchen, a coffee shop, a concierge lounge and back of house office and support areas. The project received LEED Gold certification. Regarding the hotel’s interior design, the lobby gives the feel of walking through a modern, stylized forest that features energy efficient, color kinetic light fixtures along the edges of custom “tree” columns and within the “leafy canopy” ceiling features.

Totaling over 865,000 square feet of renovations and new construction, the program also included three new residence halls which feature both apartment-style and suite-style living spaces filled with modern amenities. Given URI and Gilbane’s shared commitment to sustainability, the three new residence halls received LEED certification for New Construction.
Gilbane displayed versatility with the challenging project schedule when it was discovered that the preferred location of two of the project’s buildings were close to an environmentally-sensitive wetland. This challenge required consolidating four buildings into three, relocating two of them and consolidating two buildings into larger five-story facilities.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/university-rhode-island-dormitory-renovations/,"Client Name: University of Rhode Island

"Gilbane has been performing as construction manager for Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125 for more than 25 years totaling $175 million worth of construction and 955,000 SF. The largest, single project was an addition for the high school that included an enclosed single-story, steel-framed hallway with a glass curtainwall and a vestibule that connects multiple buildings.
The auditorium/commons building contains a 1,250-seat performing arts center with two 50-foot diameter rotating turntables that divide the theater into three smaller spaces: a 750-seat auditorium; 250-seat theater; and 250-seat recital hall. The theater is built to special acoustical specifications, which allow multiple events to occur simultaneously in three separate theaters with complete sound isolation. Each area of the auditorium is equipped with its own sound reinforcement system.
The three-story, U-shaped classroom building houses 52 classrooms including new chemistry, biology, physics and natural science laboratories, two art rooms, resource rooms and departmental offices.
Gilbane continues to work with the District on extensive projects during each summer break.

"Gilbane served as construction manager for the replacement and partial renovation to one of the oldest schools in Savannah, 50-year old Beach High School that holds significant historic value in being the first school in Georgia to educate freed slaves.
The new high school boasts 150,000 SF of new construction and 57,000 SF of renovations to house nearly 1,000 students.  Four separate specialty academies of grades 9-12: ninth grade, liberal arts, business and an allied health.  New features entailed a kitchen, cafeteria, and a centrally located administrative area for easy student and campus management. A significant highlight is the 2,000-seat, competition-grade gymnasium featuring locker and dressing rooms, physical education classrooms, weight rooms and concession areas. The former media center was converted into the new Allied Health medical magnet program. Enhanced security by zones includes glass break sensors placed throughout the school.
During our review of the building envelope in the design document phase, we engaged the services of a specialty envelope consultant to review the details to ensure the envelope was weather tight and that thermal and moisture intrusion measures were followed.  These additional inspections and review, although not part of the contract documents clearly indicated a need for testing of the windows and door systems onsite and was included in the approved guaranteed maximum price.  This process was proven to add value in finding and resolving issues of missing details that required finding the right products adding a clear benefit of providing the Owner a weathertight building for years to come.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/alfred-ely-beach-high-school-savannah-chatham-school-district/,"Client Name: Savannah-Chatham County Public School System

"This project consisted of the addition and renovation of two schools, approximately one mile and a half apart. Phase 1 of the Tioga school addition included a new school, housing students from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Technology was the centerpiece of the design, incorporating dimming lights, occupancy sensors, state-of-the-art heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls. Wireless and high-speed Internet access was streamed throughout the building, along with new projectors, phone systems, and security controls. W.A. Johnson School, formerly Mohawk school, consisted of an addition and renovations, and features 21st century learning and high efficiency design elements.
Gilbane was faced with the challenge of working on a site that contained two functional K-12 schools. The end result was a single school that took on the functionality of two schools. Construction of the new spaces took place while the school was operational, and every grade level was maintained over a three-year period. To overcome these challenges, Gilbane built all new areas during the school year and demolished older areas during the summer months, all while maintaining a secure and safe environment.
A fast-track approach was enacted from the beginning, which allowed the team to enclose necessary areas of the building before each winter, resulting in uninterrupted work year round. By taking advantage of school holidays, temporary construction partitions were moved on a regular basis, and the team completed the cafeteria area of the building a school year early.

In addition to focusing on the development PK-12 relationships between students, parents, and teachers, a primary emphasis of the campus is the integration of 21st century skills throughout the curriculum.
It is the first campus in Texas that combines school facilities to have them all interconnecting, but it took a lot of coordination for all three facilities to work as one with the common areas such as a main kitchen prep area, mechanical plant, and service yards.

"The transformation of Cleveland Heights-University Heights City School District’s Heights High School, built in 1926, included renovations and an expansion over multiple phases to address the changing needs of students in today’s learning environment.
Scope of services included:
Numerous sustainable efforts were implemented to ensure the historic features of the school were honored in a way that complemented the design, while still ensuring the continued safety of the students and staff. The façade was constructed of brick and metal panels with brick details to approximate the adjacent 1926 stone. Historically-accurate, double-hung wood windows adjacent to the existing building were installed and modern aluminum windows were put in the metal panel facade. The team was able to salvage old stone entrances and reused the existing stone to create a 25-foot security intake portal. They also reused existing sandstone entry steps and matched new stone rails at the historic courtyard entrance.
A critical component of the historic renovation was the clock tower, the peak of the building and focal point of the exterior. The team matched the existing profiles and used milled PVC product in order to restore the clock tower to its original beauty. With nearly half of the materials from the project reused in the renovation, students and faculty can walk the halls of Heights High School and know the building they are in still holds true to its 1926 roots.

Numerous sustainable efforts were implemented to ensure the historic features of the school were honored in a way that complemented the design, while still ensuring the continued safety of the students and staff. The façade was constructed of brick and metal panels with brick details to approximate the adjacent 1926 stone. Historically-accurate, double-hung wood windows adjacent to the existing building were installed and modern aluminum windows were put in the metal panel facade. The team was able to salvage old stone entrances and reused the existing stone to create a 25-foot security intake portal. They also reused existing sandstone entry steps and matched new stone rails at the historic courtyard entrance.
A critical component of the historic renovation was the clock tower, the peak of the building and focal point of the exterior. The team matched the existing profiles and used milled PVC product in order to restore the clock tower to its original beauty. With nearly half of the materials from the project reused in the renovation, students and faculty can walk the halls of Heights High School and know the building they are in still holds true to its 1926 roots.

"Gilbane was selected by the administration and Board of Education to be the construction manager at-risk for Libertyville High School’s new natatorium. U.S. News & World Report ranks the District among the Top high schools in Illinois and nationally.
The new $20 million, 50-meter natatorium includes approximately 34,000 SF of space with locker rooms, spectator areas and support spaces. Libertyville High School’s existing pool was built in 1971 and was 25 yards long, or just under 23 meters, with a shallow diving area. The new eight-lane, 50-meter pool also has a deep section for diving, giving the District expanded capacity to host additional athletic programs and competitive events. With the addition of an upgraded pool, the old pool will be repurposed into various educational spaces.
The driving and parking situation during construction, water runoff and the lack of a plan for the existing pool were the top concerns before approving permits. The project team worked collaboratively with the owner to ensure these challenges were successfully addressed throughout construction.

"Gilbane served as general contractor for Cy-Fair Independent School District’s new High School #12 and Elementary School #55, both as part of Cy-Fair ISD’s new Education Village in Cypress, TX.
The four-story high school is the tallest CFISD academic facility. The high school features a four-story academic wing, science labs, collaboration spaces, community building for fine arts and indoor athletics including a natatorium, dining facility and central utility plant building as well as competition baseball, softball, football and track facilities.
Each floor of the high school could cater to a specific grade, or floors could be geared toward certain curricula, depending on how the principal and administrative team feels they can best serve the students. The school features multipurpose spaces, including an atrium that’s placed in the middle of the building and special seating areas along the stairwell.
Keeping our children safe is a priority for school districts and something that we take very seriously at Gilbane. We utilize our experience from building in the public safety sector to bring ideas to our educational clients that can help ensure a safe and secure environment for students. The main entrance is clear and visible with glass that is glazed and bullet resistant, so school staff can see anyone who is approaching from hundreds of feet away. There are two sets of bullet resistant doors at the entrance with card readers at each set of doors, combined with hundreds of security cameras throughout the building and the school campus. There are also curtains on the classroom windows that allow the rooms to be locked and zero visibility into the classroom. While we never want to see these measures be necessary, we also know it is better to be prepared.
In lieu of an enclosed space that’s used as a common area, the schools are linked by an outdoor learning area – a resource that’s abundant in green space. Through these closely connected campuses, CFISD’s goal is to provide mentorship and leadership opportunities for older students, while also assisting younger students with the transition from elementary to middle, and middle to high school.
Additional concepts involve making use of the mechanical and electrical rooms within the high school. Instead of closing off the mechanical rooms, they will install glass walls and color-coat the piping and conduits. Science classrooms will have a section of Plexiglas into the wall to show where the piping comes in, and color-coat that to match what’s in the mechanical room to show students how electricity is delivered to the room.
The schools are built to the Collaborative for High Performance School (CHPS) Texas standards. CHPS is a non-profit organization with a mission to fundamentally change the construction of schools by encouraging the conservation of energy, water and the reduction of waste, pollution and environmental degradation.
The design incorporates sustainability elements, such as solar panels on top of canopies and a water cistern to collect rainwater and divert it for irrigation.
As a nod to the traditional concept, kindergarten through eighth grade students will share a cafeteria. During the day, the space will be divided by a folding partition, with half of the space for K-5
graders, and the other portion for older students. After school hours, however, the movable partition can be opened, providing a large, multipurpose space.

"Gilbane and Perkins Eastman DC (PEDC) recently completed the $62 million, design-build Ron Brown College Preparatory High School (RBHS). This school is the first all-male public high school in the District of Columbia. RBHS provides a student-centered, college preparatory curriculum that develops and enhances character, academic curiosity and service. The newly renovated school is 181,541 square feet and designed for 600 students. Its design features a revitalized central library that serves as the “heart” of the modernized school and a new Fraternity Hall commons that acts as its “soul.” The renovation also added a new entrance pavilion that provides a stronger civic presence to the neighborhood.
A true fast-track project, the RBHS project was delivered from program of requirements through substantial completion in just 20 months, with a construction schedule that delivered $62 million in construction in 16 months. The project scope included the abatement, interior demolition and renovation of the building in two phases. Phase one, which broke ground in the spring of 2016 and opened in August of the same year, involved modernizing the entire first floor of the complex. Renovations included an updated main entrance, new main office and administrative suite, enlarged library, multiple classrooms and labs, music room, kitchen, cafeteria, and multi-purpose space. Phase two, which opened in August 2017, included renovations of the second and third floors, the existing auditorium and the gymnasium. Phase two was delivered while the high school remained occupied and fully operational.
To support the surrounding Ward 7 community, Gilbane set up a “hub” at the Dorothy A. Height Benning Library to meet with local and disadvantaged subcontractors, suppliers and service providers interested in working on the modernization. Our outreach team met one-on-one with business owners to introduce the project and explore partnership opportunities. Over the course of a month, the team held eight targeted sessions that accommodated 21 different companies from electrical and underground utility trades to janitorial services and catering companies. The efforts connected trades with Gilbane’s prequalification process for future and current work as well as connecting the trades with prime contractors. With the help of the Ward 7 Business Partnership these outreach efforts reached dozens of small businesses located in Ward 7. The Central D.C. Mission provided janitorial services to the project, Jewel Landscape performed landscaping and Armstrong Custom Signs produced the project signage around the site. Ultimately, Gilbane awarded $48 million in CBE contracts and hired 47 Ward 7 residents.

"Gilbane is serving as construction manager for the new $47 million elementary school being built on the existing school site. The school will remain fully operational throughout construction with construction being completed in phases. The project was made possible by a successful November 2016 referendum.
During the referendum process, Gilbane partnered with the board of education, administration, building committee, community, referendum consultant and architect to determine five different project options ranging from life safety, additions and renovations to the existing East Prairie School and a new school facility. Working with a citizen task force and hosting numerous town hall meetings, Gilbane was heavily involved with community engagement events regarding safety planning, budget, schedule, phasing and logistics to provide a thorough plan for the community to understand heading into the vote. Ultimately, the community’s support resulted in a 65% yes vote.
The plan calls for a three-story building constructed in phases that will be built adjacent to the existing school. Through significant preconstruction planning and coordination efforts, students will continue to attend school as the new school is being constructed. Each floor will be divided by grade level with the first floor for the youngest students and the third floor for the middle school students.

"Gilbane delivered a seamless new state-of-the-art project for Orange County Public Schools to replace the aging Edgewater High School that has been a landmark in the College Park neighborhood since 1952. The new urban school design is a courtyard style that collapses the open space and turns it vertically to form an internalized academic spine.
At the center of the spine is a three-story day-lit atrium with three-story classroom wings that are anchored by a gymnasium on one end and the administrative suite on the other.  The new construction entailed new classrooms through tilt-up panel construction, music studio/classroom, computer labs, 1,600-seat gymnasium designated as an enhanced hurricane protection area facility, multi-purpose room with stage and kitchen, specialist rooms, information center, administrative offices, teacher work rooms, 750-seat performing arts theater and storage rooms.
Renovations occurred while school was in session and the replacement high school was situated immediately adjacent to the existing high school.  The team kept in close communications with the principal and staff and completed the work in multiple phases with fifteen buildings of three-stories each while classes were in session and fast tracked during school holidays and breaks.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/edgewater-high-school-2/,"Client Name: Orange County Public Schools

"The Town of Enfield selected Gilbane as their construction manager-at-risk for the consolidation of the Town’s two public high schools into one school. Facing an enrollment reduction, the Town chose to renovate Enfield High School to accommodate the combined student body and close Enrico Fermi High School.

"What was once a vague dream for the Falls Church Community, is now becoming a reality thanks to the Gilbane and Stantec design-build team. After many meetings, deliberation and collaboration, the Gilbane team was awarded the design-build construction of the new, $108 million high school in Falls Church, VA.
The new George Mason High School is designed for a student capacity of 1,200 students, with a maximum of 1,500 students. The purpose of the new building is to promote collaborative learning and to foster independent learners, innovators and problem solvers. Whether students bike to school, carpool with neighbors or take the bus; they will all enter through the same entrance Through the entrance, students, faculty and visitors will enter the heart of the school where a stair connects all levels of the building. The school will include:
Flexible and collaborative areas are a priority for the school. Throughout design development, the team provided solutions to address these needs. For example, the third level will act as an innovation commons. A learning stair will lead students from the commons to collaborative breakout areas on the fourth floor. To accommodate future flexibility, a three-classroom wide breakout area will be included on both the third and fourth floors. If enrollment increases significantly, this area can be fit-out for classrooms.
Designed to LEED Gold and Net Zero Ready, sustainable elements were a high priority for the community. In addition to green roofs on the third level, the building will include geothermal wells and bioretention areas around the site.
Gilbane has developed a highly technical construction plan to ensure continuous and smooth operations for the community. The team will use summer months to accomplish work best done when students and staff are away and incorporate any modifications to circulation so that they are in place when classes start back in the fall. During the school year, our team has developed a plan to maintain school activities and safety, while most effectively circulating traffic patterns, pedestrian walkways and campus parking for staff and students at both the current George Mason High School and the adjacent Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/george-mason-high-school/,"Client Name: City of Falls Church | Falls Church City Public Schools

Work entailed a new two-story 9,100 SF building to house the English and Math Departments in addition to a single story building for the Language Arts Department.  Work on this occupied campus included the replacement of the electrical service which supported half of the campus and our team was able to perform all work without interruptions to staff and students on-site.  Additional work included landscaping upgrades, entry plazas and the installation of covered walkways to adjacent buildings.
These projects were critical to the provision of the core academic program we worked closely with the District, school staff, program team and design professionals to engage with Division of the State Architect and the Office of Public School Construction in a proactive approach which resulted in a cohesive teaming with our deadlines being met and the ability to receive timely approvals keeping the project moving smoothly.

"BASIS Independent Schools is a growing national network of schools serving Pre-K through 12
grade. Working with Perkins Eastman, the Gilbane Building Company team delivered a new BASIS Independent campus in McLean, Virginia. Through a change in occupancy of a former corporate headquarters campus, BASIS Independent Schools is developing an environment uniquely suited to its STEM-focused, liberal arts program. The team took a drab and uninviting vacant office building and transformed it into a versatile educational space for students. It took the ingenuity of the design-build team to find innovative ways to turn spaces like the lobby into a gathering space instead of a means of entry, and conference rooms and cubicles into classrooms and recreational spaces fit for BASIS Independent’s challenging curriculum. Classrooms, labs, athletic, and administrative space are all organized around a central atrium that will become the heart and crossroads of the school. In addition to serving as the school’s dining room, the atrium will be the primary gathering and social activity space. In total, the site is a 220,000 SF, three-story commercial property. The initial phase was 110,000 SF and accommodates about 650 students. The second phase is slated to include a full-sized gymnasium and additional classroom space for the upper school with the goal of total enrollment at about 1,250 students.
The program was arranged around three sides of the atrium. Academic classrooms and science labs are located on the second and third floors of the east side. Elective programs, active collaboration spaces and faculty offices are located on the north side, and on the west side a large, two-story multipurpose space have been inserted on the second floor. Other community spaces, like the reading room and auditorium, performing and visual arts, as well as the administrative core, are also on the west side. The early childhood programs are located on the first floor. The program also included the reuse of an existing 200-seat auditorium, reconfigured slightly for stage performances. This design is also exploring the evolution of the BASIS branded environment – through the use of color, materials, furniture, lighting, and graphics – to create a distinctive and exciting learning ambiance.
Repositioning has become a cost effective and time saving solution for schools that are looking to find space for growing enrollments. However, it comes with the challenge of making an office complex kid friendly. With the lack of outdoor space in an urban setting, creative solutions needed to be developed to make room for traditional play spaces. At BASIS Independent McLean, exterior improvements included a playground and soft play area at the rear of the building for the preschool and kindergarten program and a large outdoor space atop the parking deck to accommodate the middle and high school students. The large outdoor space included two playground structures, artificial turf fields, and recreational courts.

"Gilbane is providing construction management at-risk services for the Houston Independent School District’s (HISD) renovation and replacement of Lamar High School – a new program designed to modernize the campus while preserving the architecturally significant building structure. The project is funded by the HISD’s $1.89 billion bond initiative to provide local schools with improved access to technology, hands-on lab spaces and classrooms that encourage collaborative learning.
To meet rising academic and technological expectations, the school is undergoing renovations with improvements including expanded classrooms, modernized facilities and numerous sports fields. A large portion of the campus will be demolished and a five-story parking garage, accommodating 1,200 parking spaces, will be constructed. A natatorium will be located atop the garage with an eight-lane, 50-meter competition pool and bleachers to hold 750 spectators.
In addition to complying with ADA standards, the new LEED certified campus will incorporate advances in energy efficiency and be more environmentally responsible. Throughout construction, special emphasis has been placed on retaining as much of the original building’s distinctive Art-Deco style as possible to preserve the strong connection students feel with the legacy of the school and deeply rooted foundation in its surrounding community.
As a main priority, Gilbane has worked to ensure that student safety and security is maintained, and academic programs aren’t compromised. Construction workers do not have any contact with students and are required to pass background checks prior to entering the work areas.

"Gilbane served as general contractor for Katy Independent School District on the new high school #8, Patricia E. Paetow High School. A modified prototype design was utilized giving the school a fresh look while adding additional modern educational facilities for a 21st century learning environment.
The 3-story high school is located on a 147-acre campus. The school contains impressive features for specialized student learning and activities. It contains classrooms supporting CTE, science labs, collaboration spaces, two dining commons, a performing arts center, four gymnasiums, a natatorium and competition baseball, softball, football and track facilities.
All science labs and some CTE program spaces are located on the third level. The administration offices, learning commons, performing arts center, separate dining commons, kitchen, physical education, CTE spaces, fine arts and other support spaces are located on the first floor. Outdoor facilities are in close proximity with parking. Located optimally for multiple concurrent events, the high school parking lot is located adjacent to the stadium, tennis courts, ball fields with nearby access to competition gymnasium and the performing arts center.
Fueled by technological advancements and a belief that classrooms should be more interactive to mirror the workplaces of today and the future, designers have been more creative in designing schools to help pursue this educational ambition.
Features such as agile learning spaces with interactive white boards and mobile furniture that can be moved to create a variety of settings have been identified by principals and educators as beneficial in meeting today’s changing needs of education.
To meet the growing demand for Career and Technology Education courses, additional lab space was incorporated. Science labs were scrutinized and adjusted to allow for the most efficient use of space, to meet safety requirements and to have ample access to power, water and technology. The use of direct and indirect daylight into learning spaces has been maximized throughout the design.
To meet the needs of a generation of students who naturally rely on technology, additional charging stations for mobile devices are prevalent.
As effective learning spaces, the classrooms are not designed for students to just sit and pay attention. Rather, they have evolved into an interactive, multi-functional space facilitating a variety of learning applications.

"Gilbane served as the construction manager at-risk for the new integrated Middle/High School. The project consisted of a gut-renovation to the pre-existing middle school and the construction of a new adjacent high school. The new high school building provides a state-of-the-art learning environment for students and faculty, offering flexible classrooms, high-tech laboratory spaces, and small group learning areas. The pre-existing 136,410 SF middle school connects to the new high school through a large open Main Street corridor. The Middle/High School shares a new performing arts center/auditorium; kitchen and cafeteria; gymnasium; library/media center; and administrative spaces as well as core mechanical spaces. Combined, the facilities will serve a total of 1,370 students in grades six through 12.
Designed to achieve LEED® Gold certification, several sustainable features were implemented in the building’s design, including a high performance exterior wall system consisting of high visible light transmittance, daylight dimming light controls with photocells, and water systems allowing for increased water efficiency through the use of low-flow fixtures.
The four-phased construction schedule allowed occupancy of the new high school prior to the middle school renovation. The schedule was compressed, where possible, in order to expedite the opportunity for students to move into the new high school. Additionally, the project required extensive site work due to the existing middle school topography which required large cut-and-fill quantities of land. The project scope also included the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, abatement and demolition of the existing high school, and extensive athletic field work including the construction of a softball and practice field, discus/javelin field, and a team room to serve the existing football field.

"By the end of October2015, Roosevelt High School was completely transformed from an old, dilapidated 1930’s high school to a new 21st century learning environment. Its crumbling ceilings and cracked floors were restored to their 1930’s glory, while the dark and gloomy interior became a thing of the past.
In the 1970’s an infill addition was constructed to create more enclosed square footage for the high school students. With our 21st century modernization, the original 1930’s courtyard has been reopened as a waterworks courtyard by demolishing the addition that had been built to cover it up. The waterworks courtyard is one of the many sustainable features of the newly renovated high school, containing 3 cisterns with the capacity to hold 55,000 gallons of water for flushing toilets. It will be used as a teaching tool for students to learn about storm water management. On the other hand, the atrium that was once an open-air courtyard between the original 1930’s building and the infill addition, is now an enclosed atrium designed as “the heart” of the building. Standing in the atrium are 65-foot columns, which had to be welded off-site due to their magnitude. Enclosing the atrium is the 10,000-square foot skylight that has turned this once unused space into a gathering point and social area. The skylight uses electrochromic glazing, which reacts to sunlight in order to cut down on heat gain that in turn requires less energy to cool the space. Through value engineering, the Smoot | Gilbane joint venture team was able to keep this essential design element without exceeding the budget.
Surrounding you as you stand in this newly revitalized space are the beautifully restored 1930’s windows. The windows are an example of the craftsmanship that has gone into making this building magnificent. Worcester Eisenbrandt, along with AVSmoot, a woman-owned CBE contractor, brought the 100 worn down and out-of-date historic windows back to their 1930’s splendor. The double-hung windows use special hardware to hinge the sashes, while the frames were sealed to the brick for waterproofing. Therefore, the entire window could not be removed and had to be restored in phases. The sashes were removed and restored off-site at AV Smoot where they were stripped, re-stained, and glazed to ensure proper sound control. As for the frames, Worcester Eisenbrandt restored them in-place using the same process.
Another defining element of the design is the commanding cupola that sits atop the high school that was restored to its original specifications. From looking at the original historic 1930’s drawings, the team believed it wasn’t initially built the way the designer had intended. Smoot | Gilbane and Perkins Eastman DC worked with the Historic Preservation Review Board to fill in the design gaps so that our team could get the details just right.

"Gilbane is serving as construction manager at-risk (CM at-Risk) for the New School at the Wilson Site in Arlington, Virginia. This high profile, multi-story secondary school will include four terraces, a green roof, classrooms, labs, music rooms, gym, cafeteria, media center, auditorium, soccer field, hardscape plaza and a parent drop off lane. Located in a highly visible, urban site in the Rosslyn neighborhood, the building will have a unique cascading design that will foster collaboration and inclusion between the Stratford and H-B Woodlawn programs. A cascading stair will run through the center of the building to provide quick access to each of the three levels of the building. Roof terraces will be incorporated on each level, creating access to additional open space a small urban site can’t typically provide.
Early involvement in the project has been an integral part of the project’s success thus far. Gilbane was engaged with the project during preconstruction, using
principles such as
, to look proactively at schedule risks and gain an in-depth understanding of each company’s role throughout the life of the project. During this process, the abatement and demolition of the century-old, multi-story existing Wilson School building was identified as a key milestone. Gilbane collaborated with the State of Virginia, Arlington County, APS, and a third party monitor to remediate existing asbestos from the original school building. The original building included multiple additions, varying in age, which made the remediation process more complex. Careful planning and protection measures were put in place to ensure the preservation and removal of historic fabric from the building, including the salvage of exterior masonry, for reuse in the new construction.
The complex layout and design of the structure provided another opportunity for early planning. The urban setting, in addition to the technical complexities of the design, minimized the staging and laydown space available during construction.  During the Advanced Planning and Scheduling session, the team determined that a large tower crane would be needed for the concrete placement and steel erection.

"The project consisted of new construction and renovations to an existing occupied 1950’s era campus in a very tight community atmosphere. Construction took place while class is in session with 3 major phases and a total of 22 intermediate phases completed throughout the entire duration of the project, with many occurring in the summers and holiday breaks. Construction took place over a 4 year period to allow the existing campus to operate with as little disruption as possible on such a tight area. Challenges include intense coordination between all trades in order to keep the existing underground utility lines free from damage and to keep the campus operational during construction.
The new high school consists of 12 buildings including all site work, renovations, additions, landscaping and hardscaping.

"The project consisted of new construction and renovations to an existing occupied 1950’s era campus in a very tight community atmosphere. Construction took place while class is in session with 3 major phases and a total of 22 intermediate phases completed throughout the entire duration of the project, with many occurring in the summers and holiday breaks. Construction took place over a 4 year period to allow the existing campus to operate with as little disruption as possible on such a tight area. Challenges include intense coordination between all trades in order to keep the existing underground utility lines free from damage and to keep the campus operational during construction.
The new high school consists of 12 buildings including all site work, renovations, additions, landscaping and hardscaping.

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for multiple projects within the Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. The renovation projects  were completed by the Gilbane team while the hospital remained fully operational during construction. The renovations included the installation of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), radiology rooms, transfer switch equipment, as well as renovations to the exterior of the emergency department façade. Because the projects were completed at an active hospital, they required sensitivity to avoid contamination to adjacent rooms and nearby spaces.
This project included the installation of a new single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including architectural, mechanical and electrical installation work. The 2,000 SF facility is immediately adjacent to the existing emergency room of Arnold Hospital for Children. The Gilbane team had to take extra precautions working on the project due to its sensitive location.
Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children is recognized by the American College of Radiology (ACR) as an accredited imaging center in the areas of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nuclear Medicine and Ultrasound. Arnold Palmer Hospital is number one for treating some of the toughest children’s health issues in the Central Florida area and requires a high degree of care regarding infection control. With this requirement in mind, Gilbane Building Company, along with Fred M. Humphrey & Associates architects, was given the contract for demolition and improvement to the first floor, which included installation of a new MRI suite and x-ray change-out. This 12,370 SF project required the relocation of an existing x-ray room and staff-lounge as well as the build-out of four pre and post operation rooms and extensive renovations to the corridor entering into the MRI Suite. Upgrades and improvements to mechanical/electrical/plumbing and fire protection were also included in the project within the hospital.
The project involved the installation of the automatic transfer switching equipment for the emergency power system at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. The project involved over 10,000 SF of renovated space including new walls, doors and fan coil unit in the Central Energy Plant (CEP).
This project involved the renovation of two new pieces of radiology equipment including the complete renovation of approximately 5,000 SF in the rooms containing this equipment.
This project involved the demolition of buildings at the emergency department and revisions to connecting walkways approximately 3,600 SF. Gilbane had to keep the hospital and emergency department operating without interruption throughout construction.
Gilbane’s 30+ years of experience working with the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) in Florida has resulted in a complete and thorough understanding of the requirements and regulations necessary for construction planning. This expertise ensures Gilbane’s project team successfully meets all AHCA requirements.

The project team installed over 20 miles of underground conduit in order to tie the new plant back to the existing hospital.  Excavations to a depth of 15 feet required the installation of 11 layers of new medium voltage and cabling during a heavy tropical rain season.
Gilbane expertly handled the relocation of the existing heliport, managed the construction and coordination of six, two-megawatt generators along with associated switchgear, automatic transfer switches, fuel oil piping and tanks, complete SCADA communication system and total integration and upgrades of the Johnson Control automation system building.
Constant communication was the key factor in initializing various phases of underground connections to safeguard patients, doctors, administration, faculty and emergency traffic flow against any disruption.

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for the phased modernization of Doctors Community Hospital’s Surgical Center, while the hospital remained fully occupied. This two-phase project included both renovations and an addition with five new OR rooms, as well as a new pre-operative services department and administrative support spaces at the hospital.
The two-story building addition houses three new operating rooms on the upper level, while the lower level provides storage and can accommodate future expansion. Renovation activities included converting existing shell space into a staff lounge and new surgical staff locker rooms, as well as the construction of a new 18-bed PACU. A new air handling unit and chiller were installed to support this program and provide capacity for future renovations to the remaining OR suites.  All of these renovations occurred within the heart of the active surgery department.  Careful logistics planning and infection control measures were meticulously pursued to allow for a successful construction phase.
The two-story addition expands into the existing staff parking area on the east side of the building. This new expansion is supported by structural steel frame resting on concrete spread footers, many of which were underpinned along the existing building. The new exterior façade matches the existing façade, which consists of a unit masonry wall system.

A new air handling unit and chiller were installed to support this program and provide capacity for future renovations to the remaining OR suites.  All of these renovations occurred within the heart of the active surgery department.  Careful logistics planning and infection control measures were meticulously pursued to allow for a successful construction phase.
The two-story addition expands into the existing staff parking area on the east side of the building. This new expansion is supported by structural steel frame resting on concrete spread footers, many of which were underpinned along the existing building. The new exterior façade matches the existing façade, which consists of a unit masonry wall system. To express appreciation to charitable donors, engraved masonry will be added to the walls and sidewalk.  The addition was built overtop the existing and active loading dock for the hospital.  Construction activities were carefully coordinated with the vendors and hospital, to allow daily deliveries to be maintained while building in a safe manner.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/doctors-community-hospital-operation-room-renovations/,"Client Name: Doctors Community Hospital

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services, including MEFP trade coordination through building information modeling and managed the architectural selection process for Edgerton Hospital and Health Service’s new critical access hospital. This 16-bed hospital was constructed on a rural, 70-acre site. The hospital consists of an emergency department, imaging, surgery, laboratory, clinics/urgent care, inpatient/outpatient rehabilitation therapy services, cardiac rehabilitation, and inpatient units. The hospital is also home to several support services including dietary, health information management, administration, human resources, conference rooms, materials management, housekeeping, and facilities maintenance.
It was a goal of the entire team to design and construct a highly efficient, maintenance-friendly HVAC system that would offer the benefits of newer technologies, providing comfort and safety to the occupants. This was achieved by using a geothermal system to produce all the heating and cooling in the building with no supplemental sources, allowing the hospital to use up to 40% less energy than comparable hospitals. The system consists of a series of 300 wells drilled nearly 200 feet below the surface. The ER and OR are served by two rooftop air handling units supplied with hot and chilled water, from the water to water heat pump plant. The rest of the building is served by water to air heat pumps with dedicated outside air systems that allow zone-level control, satisfying the diverse levels of climate control needs within the hospital.

"Gilbane provided CM at-risk services for the construction of two 40,000 SF, two-story buildings that included a licensed hospital and emergency care center on the ground floors and shell office space on the second floor together with all related site paving, drainage, and other improvements. The emergency care features include: exam, treatment and procedure spaces, nursing rooms and an imaging department including CT scan equipment.
The sitework consisted of concrete paving, landscaping, irrigation and storm water retention features, including a concrete WPAP basin specifically designed to capture, and slowly release, all accumulated storm water run-off. On one of the sites, the entire building pad and paving area had to be excavated through solid rock. Also included on one of the sites was a helicopter pad for emergency transfer of patients. Each building was designed as a concrete tilt-wall structure with a limestone, curtainwall, and metal siding facade and a membrane roof.
Once construction was underway, we were asked to accelerate the schedule by Emerus. This was accomplished utilizing detailed scheduling sessions with the trades, particularly with regards to the timing of City inspections. Because of our efforts, the project was delivered earlier than originally planned without a corresponding increase in price to Emerus.
The schedule was aggressive, but with accurate and timely pricing, it was completed ahead of time and within budget. To achieve the schedule goal, critical subcontractors worked extended days and weeks.

"Gilbane Building Company has successfully delivered a new two-story outpatient clinic to provide world class medical services for active duty personnel and families stationed at Holloman Air Force Base (AFB). The clinic houses active military, fight medicine, family health, public health, pediatric outpatient care, as well as ancillary functions, including pharmacy, physical therapy, radiology, lab, administration, and support areas.
A collaborative project approach incorporated current best evidence-based design features and allowed the team to achieve performance and social responsibility goals. Temperature extremes, low humidity intermittently punctuated by periods of significant precipitation, corrosive soils, high winds, and fierce solar radiation are addressed with efficient, cost-effective, and permanent solutions, including solar screening of glazed areas and evaporative cooling in fully shaded courtyards.
Durable materials and finishes are used throughout the facility to promote infection prevention and conform to stringent federal design criteria. Sustainable design strategies are incorporated into the facility’s design in order to achieve a United States Green Building Council LEED® Silver rating.
The design-build team utilized Autodesk Revit® BIM, laser scanning, and fast-tracking of design packages in order to achieve cost and schedule efficiencies. Following completion of the facility,
services successfully transitioned 230 people from the old clinic to the new clinic in less than three days.

"Replacing Houston Medical Center was a monumental task that demanded detailed early planning. Using Gilbane’s Healthcare CostAdvisor, we assisted the hospital to evaluate almost 40 different design and construction sequence concepts, assessing both revenue and non-revenue generating space, as well as new versus renovated areas. This analysis led the hospital to invest more in Phase 1 to create new revenue generating space, so that Phase 2 could be partly funded from the increased revenue from Phase 1.
Prior to construction of the new four-story bed tower and renovations to the existing facility, Gilbane began construction of a new state-of-the-art Central Energy Plant (CEP) with capacity to support the new campus. Building the CEP on an occupied and fully operational hospital campus involved extensive planning and coordination to ensure that necessary shut-downs and tie-ins of new electrical would never impact patient care.
The new tower houses admitting, dietary and public support on the first floor, as well as 46 medical surgery beds, 20 critical care beds, and 12 step-down beds, NICU, nursery and 25 post-partum beds on the upper floors. The lower level includes shelled space/storage, education and medical records space.

"Gilbane | Knutson formed a joint venture for this complex proton treatment facility being built adjacent to imaging and treatment facilities at Mayo Clinic. Designed and constructed to support future tower expansion, the four-story (two levels below-grade and two levels above) houses a fixed proton beam treatment room and four gantries.
Getting to patient treatment drove the project schedule. All activities and durations were closely coordinated with the owner’s schedule requirements for commissioning and start-up, to achieve the earliest possible date for treatment of the first patient in the new facility. During preconstruction, Gilbane coordinated with the proton therapy equipment vendor (PTEV) representatives, the owner’s physicists and facilities personnel to build a schedule that incorporated the proton therapy equipment manufacturing and delivery times into the overall schedule as well as their installation, commissioning and start-up activities. Through close coordination with the owner and the PTEV, Gilbane’s collaborative approach led to a unique solution where two machines were turned over at a time, resulting in much earlier patient treatment than if all four gantries were finished at the same time.

"This program enabled the hospital to embark on a major bed tower expansion on their main campus and included a new central energy plant (CEP), more than 1,500 feet of underground utility tunnels, a renovation of the existing loading dock, and demolition of two buildings.
Replacing the powerhouse, the new CEP supplies power, chilled water, domestic water, and high pressure steam to the existing hospital facility through a single underground utility tunnel and to the new replacement bed tower through two, new utility tunnels. The process of switching utilities from the old power plant to the new CEP were seamless to ensure NCH could operate at its highest potential and provide the best care to its patients.
Our team proactively implemented many upfront cost control strategies to ensure owner savings. For example, there were 36 utility cutovers in the project which involved numerous complexities and subcontractor partners. Implementing a design-assist delivery and gathering the subcontractor’s input allowed for the team to proactively engage in cost saving suggestions to bring the mechanical and electrical trades into the process early.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/nationwide-childrens-hospital-central-energy-plant/,"Client Name: Nationwide Children’s Hospital

"Gilbane provided construction management services for the renovation and expansion of the 73,000 SF existing Adult Emergency Department located on the ground floor of the Vanderbilt clinic. The new Adult Emergency Department is double the original size of the space, with dedicated treatment and specialist spaces, allowing the hospital to treat more patients and provide them with better care through a more efficient space.
As part of this project, the Energy Court was converted to a dedicated waiting room for the Adult Emergency Department (AED) and a new Rapid Medical Evaluation (RME) area consisting of five new triage bays and 26 new exam/treatment bays. The refurbishment and expansion also included a new waiting room, entrance, trauma and ambulance corridor, acute care space, staff support, and dedicated radiology and psychology areas. These are in addition to the existing 45 treatment spaces in emergency department patient care areas A, B, C and D.
The five-phase approach included:
Phase 1 – Construction of a temporary emergency department waiting and registration area as well as a triage space to enable the emergency department to continue full operation during construction of the new entrance, waiting room, triage, and RME.
Phase 2 – Full gut renovation of the existing administrative office suites on the first floor and MEP fit-out to make room for the construction of new emergency department observation rooms. This phase also included 15 fully enclosed single-occupancy patient rooms, supporting charting stations, medication area, crash cart alcove, nutrition station, bathrooms and showers.
Phase 3 – Demolition of the main entrance 5-story atrium to build a new dedicated ambulatory entrance and waiting area for the Adult Emergency Department and public hospital entrance. The construction of the enclosed MER  penthouse with all new MEP infrastructure for future phases was completed as well as all exterior work along Broadway including landscaping, façade work, and sidewalk refinishing.
Phase 4 – Construction of a new trauma room with acute care tow beds immediately adjacent to the ambulance bay. This phase also included 13 new treatment bays and charting stations along with minor re-routing of the corridor to accommodate the new trauma room and the relocation of an existing shower room.
Phase 5 – Renovation of existing Area B to create new code compliant treatment and support spaces, including 14 treatment bays and acute care treatment rooms. In addition, the temporary waiting and registration facilities adjacent to Area D were transformed into the permanent staff lounge and locker room.
Respecting the fully operational hospital throughout all stages of the project was critical to its success. While the new space was created to improve patient care, it was vital to maintain a high standard of hygiene and minimize disruption throughout the construction period. Consistent communication, critical programming and dedication to dust containment were all vital factors in ensuring a smooth project journey that allowed for the continuity of patient care.

"Gilbane provided construction management services for a major project at the NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital. The multi-phased project spanned four years across various floors and departments. All construction activities were planned and coordinated within the fully occupied children’s hospital, which at times included working adjacent to patients in ICU beds. The project components included a Pediatric MRI, exam suites, Antepartum Maternity Unit, Digestive Health, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and a Cardiac Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU).
Multi-phased upgrades first took place to the existing MEP infrastructure of the Hospital’s north and central buildings to meet the service capacities necessary for the additional upgrades. This included the removal and replacement of equipment and associated distribution systems, such as chillers, air handling units, steam generators, expansion tanks, hydronic pumps, control panels, exhaust fans, pneumatic air stations and dry-coolers, as well as new medical-gas risers with future valves on each floor. The majority of the scope took place in the Hospital’s penthouse MER and adjacent roofs, requiring new steel dunnage and extensive coordination for equipment rigs and routing of distribution systems.
The team refurbished 10,500 square feet for the PICU which included 14 private rooms, each equipped with pre-fabricated headwall units, custom footwalls and dedicated family areas with sleeper-sofas, wardrobes and televisions, as well as new spaces for support services, waiting and consultation areas. A full gut renovation of 12,000 square feet then created space for the new antepartum department. The previous PICU space was converted into the NICU, which now features private and semi-private patient rooms, as well as airborne infectious isolation rooms. This unit was created to support the Hospital’s cardiac surgery program. The patient rooms are equipped with modular-built headwall systems, including medical gases, critical and normal power and dialysis boxes. The infrastructure work was phased throughout the duration of the project to ensure each phase would be ready in time to support the new spaces as they were completed.
MINIMIZING DISRUPTION
A major challenge in an existing hospital with buildings close to one hundred years old, is to understand and remediate the existing conditions uncovered during the renovation project. In an effort to streamline existing condition documentation and remediation efforts, Gilbane utilized our 3D scanning services to tackle two jobs at once on the 9N NICU project. With limited deck-to-slab heights, critical MEP services and unforgiving existing conditions, the scanning provided Gilbane with an all-encompassing 3D model. This technology allowed Gilbane to finish MEP coordination faster than scheduled and with greater accuracy, directly resulting in cost and scheduling benefits. In addition, the integration of BIM 360 allowed Gilbane to proactively log and track the progress of remediation efforts, rolling completion lists and punchlists, with customizable reports for the client and trade contractors. Putting quality at the forefront, this software allowed the Gilbane team to setup automated weekly reports with the trade contractors to document benchmark quality inspections, upcoming tasks and architect/engineer punchlist items.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/newyork-presbyterian-hospital-morgan-stanley-childrens-hospital/,"Client Name: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital

"Located on a 40-acre wooded site overlooking Lake Michigan, this sustainably-designed, 63,753 SF critical access care hospital includes 12 inpatient beds; space for outpatient rehabilitation, laboratory, radiology and dietary services; an attached medical office building housing physicians’ offices; and community education space. The new facility allows Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital to attract and retain high quality physicians to provide top tier healthcare services and meet the future needs of the community. This project increased the satisfaction of residents who were previously traveling more than 90 miles to receive tertiary care services.

"Gilbane provided transition planning and management services to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for the 1.6 million square foot new clinical building. The new building houses two distinct programs into a single structure: the 560,000 square foot Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children’s Center and the 913,000 square foot Sheikh Zayed Adult Tower.
The hospital staff knows how to move patients, but it’s not every day that they move hundreds of patients at one time. Of the 1000+ hospital bed system, the new building required relocating 560 patient beds, which included over 180 intensive care unit (ICU) beds – the most critical patients in the hospital.
Gilbane prepared the staff for the transition by providing a detailed roadmap that tracked the progress of the entire project and supported the relocations of patients, staff and equipment by providing logistics planning, move manuals and hosting “day-in-the-life” training sessions. In preparation for the final move, hundreds of staff participated in mock moves. The Gilbane team performed operational interviews and facilitated several workgroup meetings to ensure that all patient care and procedure areas were prepared with the equipment and resources required to maintain normal operations 24/7 throughout the transition period.

"Gilbane is providing construction management at-risk services for the construction of a new 40,000 SF, two-story outpatient medical office building facility that will house proton therapy and linear radiation located on the campus of Delray Medical Center. With proton therapy, protons can be precisely conformed to release most of their energy directly in the tumor, greatly reducing damage to nearby healthy tissue. As a non-invasive and painless option, it is the most precise form of radiation treatment available today, thus patients receive more effective doses and generally have far fewer side effects from treatment.
The Delray Proton Therapy center will stand amongst a select group of treatment centers in the United States that will offer the latest proton therapy technology. This will also be the very first Varian Center in the State of Florida.

"This complex 204,000 SF renovation project converted vacant space into patient floors with a total of 203 new beds. The scope of work also included support work in multiple mechanical spaces to provide new equipment and four new air handling units. The patient rooms included 92 med-surge rooms, 37 observation rooms, 56 ICU rooms and 18 isolation rooms. The 3rd floor build-out also included a burn unit, while the 4th floor includes a radial lounge, PT/OT suite, and procedure room for the Heart and Vascular Department.
The project team collaborated with UCM during a series of Kaizen events that resulted in design features to optimize flow and maximize efficiency and eliminate waste to improve patient care and safety for patients and staff. The design enhanced patient visibility and also created standardized support spaces and decentralized supply storage, which maximized support for Lean operations in addition to locating equipment and supplies for a more convenient point of use and enhancing patient comfort.
This challenging project was completed in an active hospital environment with strict infection control requirements and situated on a tight urban site. As an additional challenge, the work was located between a procedure floor on the fifth floor and the blood bank and pharmacy on the second floor, resulting in limited access and requiring meticulous planning to eliminate hospital operational impacts.

"As one of the first proton therapy centers in America, constructed over 10 years ago, the University of Florida (UF) Health Proton Therapy Institute  is at the forefront of radiation oncology. Cancer treatment, and in particular particle therapy technology, is constantly evolving. UF Health Proton Therapy Institute set out to develop a strategy to upgrade their existing three gantries with the latest technology; however, impacting their current patient treatment capacity was simply not an option. This challenge was the stimulus to consider expanding utilizing a compact “single room” treatment system.

The expansion will be approximately 10,000 SF over two floors constructed immediately adjacent to the east side of the current building and will ultimately increase treatment capacity by 33%. The new expansion will house Ion Beam Applications’ Proteus©One compact proton therapy equipment for state-of-the-art treatment. In addition to the complex challenges that come along with proton therapy construction, this project requires tremendous efforts to manage a site bordered by the existing facility, Hogan Creek and two busy city streets. Once complete, the new patient treatment capacity will allow UF Health Proton Therapy Institute to phase in upgrades to the original three gantries while always maintaining their current treatment capacity.

"Gilbane provided design phase and construction management services for the new University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center George and Cynthia Mitchell Basic Sciences Research Building. This project consisted of a completely new research facility which replaced an existing research laboratory and vivarium space used by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The facility accommodates both the Cancer Center and The University of Texas Health Science Center- Houston Research.
The 890,000 SF Basic Sciences Research Building features two floors of vivarium space and six floors of research laboratories. In addition to the vivarium and research laboratories, other components of the building include office space, graduate school of biomedical sciences, conference rooms, public lobby/gallery and building support space.
The height of the building is equivalent to a 16-story building because there is an interstitial floor above each laboratory floor. All MEP services are located on the interstitial floors, which provide easy access and maintenance without disrupting sensitive research. The total interstitial space is 365,000 SF.
Upon completion of the schematic design estimate, Gilbane received positive comments for its efforts.
said Jim Victor, (former) senior project manager, University of Texas OFPC. Gilbane tracked all of the estimates to the original benchmark estimate developed by the design team of FKP Architects in association with Zimmer Gunsul Frasca partnership.

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for the modernization program at White Plains Hospital Center. The modernization project was delivered in phases to alleviate any disruption to patient care. The overall goal of the project was to maximize the functionality of space across three contiguous buildings and to improve the aesthetic, resulting in more attractive and functional spaces. Project components included:
One-hour rated sound-damping construction entrances with negative pressure ante-rooms were implemented for dust containment, as well as careful noise control. Constant communication with the hospital and advance warning for noisy works ensured disruption was kept to an absolute minimum. A flexible approach to changing schedules for noisy works was also implemented to suit the hospital and their care requirements.

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for multiple projects within Orlando Health’s Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies.
Infant Milk: This project provided space for mothers to give (mother’s) milk and store it for their newborn babies. The facility offers a relaxing space for mothers to lactate for their babies and a pass through to a sterile area where the milk can be stored. The project involved the renovation of surrounding areas within Winnie Palmer Hospital, and is directly adjacent to the third floor neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Hospital Finish Upgrades: The scope involved renovation to six floors of patient rooms including corridors, nursing stations, and all lobbies. The Finishes Upgrade project required extensive infection control measures, as the renovation involved all patient rooms, all patient corridors, nursing stations, and all lobbies. The project also involved over 120,000 square feet of renovation. The hospital remained fully operational during the renovation and required close coordination with hospital staff to ensure patient safety and privacy.
Hospital Fountain Upgrade: This project involved the complete renovation of the fountain at the main entrance to Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies. The project included rerouting of all hospital pedestrian and vehicular traffic to a temporary entrance providing temporary covered walkways, infection control barriers and the addition of a new completed sealed water feature that encases the entrance to the hospital with LED lighting.
ECHO Project: This project involved the renovation of 500 square feet of space for an ECHO reading room at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies. The ECHO renovation project added millwork, flooring, drywall, and plumbing upgrades to the space.
OR Equipment Upgrade: The project involved upgrades to the steris booms in eight of the existing operating rooms within Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies. The 3,484 square foot project involved multiple trades, intensive ICRA measures, and complex phasing.

The project included new glass curtain wall as well as structural glazing at the newly constructed two-story atrium.

The renovation will provide elevator modernizations, mechanical upgrades, fire panel and life safety upgrades, paver and landscaping upgrades on 19

While the ground floor retail remained occupied, the existing façade was replaced with new curtain wall in a phased approach to minimize disruption to the building occupants. Temporary partitions were installed to maintain a safe and weather tight barrier while the facade was being replaced in a small tenant area that had existing finishes to remain.

"Gilbane provided construction management services for the interior fit-out of the fifth floor for CardWorks Processing. The 30,000 SF project was extremely fast tracked to renovate the floor into CardWorks flagship office. The space includes open office areas, meeting areas, conference rooms, breakrooms and a 2,500 SF Mission Critical Data Center to aid in their 24/7 operation. The project was completed in 5 phases, and in under three months, with the first phase being the office area. Phase 2-4 included completion of the data center and addition of a generator.
The Gilbane team paired with experienced trade partners to complete this project – relying on their understanding of the interiors renovations and their professionalism in delivering client excellence. Having the right trades on board from the start, minimized punch lists items at the end and kept the project on track to be delivered on time. The project included the complete gutting of the space and redesigning the entire interior. The team drove quality workmanship from everyone throughout the project. Facing the challenge of re-sequencing of the construction activities created a chaotic schedule and quality check order. To address this, the team and trade partners were diligent in keeping rolling completion lists rather than a punch list. We used BIM 360 to create the rolling completion lists rather than waiting until the end of the project. This saved much needed time for the team for this fast track project. Through careful pre-planning and detailed communications, the team delivered the transformational project with high end finishes and tons of natural light.
Function and aesthetics were equally important for this client to create an aesthetically pleasing and collaborative work space. The breakroom and meeting rooms were designed to be a space for employees to congregate and are suited for conversation. The layout and design allows for workplace flexibility which enables teams and individuals to shape space on the fly for enhanced interaction. Innovation is nurtured through informal, social, and creative interactions. The intent of the design was to create a visually appealing atmosphere with soothing finishes which were selected to not only deliver and position the CardWorks brand and culture, but to also create a want to work space. While technology may be visible or invisible in these settings, it is integral to how teams work in the environment. In an open collaborative space, noise levels will be amplified, with more people sharing the same workspace. Sound masking technology was installed to limit the interruptions and noise from neighboring work spaces.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/cbre-group-inc-cardworks-interior-fit-out/,"Client Name: CBRE Group Inc.

"Gilbane provided construction management services for the interior fit-out of the fifth floor for CardWorks Processing. The 30,000 SF project was extremely fast tracked to renovate the floor into CardWorks flagship office. The space includes open office areas, meeting areas, conference rooms, breakrooms and a 2,500 SF Mission Critical Data Center to aid in their 24/7 operation. The project was completed in 5 phases, and in under three months, with the first phase being the office area. Phase 2-4 included completion of the data center and addition of a generator.
The Gilbane team paired with experienced trade partners to complete this project – relying on their understanding of the interiors renovations and their professionalism in delivering client excellence. Having the right trades on board from the start, minimized punch lists items at the end and kept the project on track to be delivered on time. The project included the complete gutting of the space and redesigning the entire interior. The team drove quality workmanship from everyone throughout the project. Facing the challenge of re-sequencing of the construction activities created a chaotic schedule and quality check order. To address this, the team and trade partners were diligent in keeping rolling completion lists rather than a punch list. We used BIM 360 to create the rolling completion lists rather than waiting until the end of the project. This saved much needed time for the team for this fast track project. Through careful pre-planning and detailed communications, the team delivered the transformational project with high end finishes and tons of natural light.
Function and aesthetics were equally important for this client to create an aesthetically pleasing and collaborative work space. The breakroom and meeting rooms were designed to be a space for employees to congregate and are suited for conversation. The layout and design allows for workplace flexibility which enables teams and individuals to shape space on the fly for enhanced interaction. Innovation is nurtured through informal, social, and creative interactions. The intent of the design was to create a visually appealing atmosphere with soothing finishes which were selected to not only deliver and position the CardWorks brand and culture, but to also create a want to work space. While technology may be visible or invisible in these settings, it is integral to how teams work in the environment. In an open collaborative space, noise levels will be amplified, with more people sharing the same workspace. Sound masking technology was installed to limit the interruptions and noise from neighboring work spaces.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/cbre-group-inc-cardworks-interior-fit-out/,"Client Name: CBRE Group Inc.

"The Tier III facility was constructed in 17 months and provides critical storage for the world-class hospital system. The modular design included 20,000 SF of white space on a 36-inch raised floor with 150 W per SF power capacity. Additional access floor is utilized for staging, demark, and CRAH unit gallery.
Collaborative preconstruction services included Interdisciplinary Document Coordination (IDC) reviews which reduced RFIs, contractor presentations for mechanical, electrical contractors as well as BMS and generator vendors to ensure equipment met Clinic standards, and BIM co-location for quick resolutions.
The client’s immediate need to accommodate technology growth forced innovative construction sequencing that would allow work to progress on schedule through the toughest of Cleveland winters. To avoid delays during preconstruction, Gilbane collaboratively worked with the design team to release early site, concrete and steel packages, allowing the building to be enclosed prior to the onset of the inclement weather. Gilbane also worked closely with the structural engineer to provide building foundations four feet below grade that allowed intricate electrical work to be installed in layers from the bottom up and under cover through the winter.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/cleveland-clinic-data-center/,"Client Name: Cleveland Clinic

"Located in the One Prudential Plaza building, the 22,000 SF project consisted of creative collaborative spaces, high-end finishes and custom artwork for a confidential client. Unique features included custom, solid ash wood slat ceilings with concealed mounting hardware for the west wall, elevator vestibule and main reception corridor. Vertical boards line up with custom ceiling slats to create a railroad look. A custom skyline of back-painted glass was created for the east wall of the elevator vestibule as well as multiple offices and open work spaces.
A hexagon-shaped fabric wrapped around the acoustical panels was installed in multiple offices and huddle spaces to provide sound attenuation and add a splash of color to the space. Offices were also designed with All Steel Beyond Wall glass fronts, which provide more natural light in collaborative spaces and connect offices to the open floor plan.
One of the coolest aspects of this office renovation was the custom artwork designed for the space. A local graffiti artist was commissioned to paint custom spray-painted murals in the main reception corridor and employee break room. The employee breakroom also has a custom white ping pong table, wood crate exposed ceiling, granite waterfall legs for the island, just to name a few unique features.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/confidential-client-downtown-high-rise-restacking/,"Client Name: Confidential Client

"This new CVS Retail Store #07683 in Stateline, Nevada resides in an existing building in the South Lake Tahoe Area formerly known as Bill’s Casino Lake Tahoe right along Highway 50.  The building has been divided up into roughly 7 to 8 different tenant spaces, and CVS was the first tenant to occupy one.  The retail store consists of roughly 9,500 SF of retail space, 1,000 SF of receiving area, and a total square footage of 11,102 SF.  All site utilities and building exterior skin improvements were completed under a separate contract between Gilbane Building Company and the Landlord (SS Management LLC).  Some of the larger renovation requirements for this interior tenant improvement were structural plate steel retrofits downstairs in the basement below the CVS retail space, as well as layers of high density foam under a new concrete floor slab in one half of the retail space to level the entire sales floor uniformly.
Northern Nevada Office’s SPG group obtained substantial completion of the CVS Retail Store project on April 13th, 2012, and was successful in meeting the owner’s request to accelerate the schedule and complete the project 2 weeks faster than the originally contracted 17 week schedule. CVS’ Setup Crew took beneficial occupancy of the space and began stocking shelves with merchandise early; the store opened on May 5th, 2012 a day earlier than originally scheduled.

"Gilbane Building Company began its engagement with ExxonMobil for a new 385 acre campus project in the fall of 2009, providing budgeting, schedule development, consultant selection, constructability and overall logistics planning services for the Campus Project. In the fall of 2010, Gilbane successfully competed for and was awarded the site development and infrastructure construction work; including Parking Garages, Central Plant, Computing Facility, Roadways/Bridges and related service ways. Subsequently, we were awarded the contracts to build all the remaining buildings on the campus in 2011.
The campus includes 14 low-rise office buildings, three parking garages to accommodate more than 10,000 employees, large central campus commons, laboratory building, child care center, and a comprehensive roadway system with bridges, a state-of-the-art central utility plant, and all new utility services to the project site. The project utilized an open-plan configuration to allow maximum flexibility for employees while creating a high-quality working environment. The gateway to the campus is through the Energy Center, which provides training and conference facilities together with reception and dining areas. Among the features highlighting this modern architecture, is a 180’x180’ glass cube suspended by large cantilevered steel trusses.
A large central commons area joined by adjacent promenades connects the buildings, both internally and externally, using sustainable materials and natural plantings as part of the overall hardscape/landscaping approach taken to encourage collaboration throughout the workplace. The campus includes a 100,000 SF wellness center that provides group fitness programs, cardio and weight lifting equipment, and locker room facilities.

"Flats East Bank Development consists of a three-story, 545-car parking garage, a 22-story office building complex to house tenants including Ernst & Young, Tucker Ellis & West, CBRE, and a six-story Aloft Hotel. Gilbane’s Cleveland District office is also headquartered in the new tower.  The transit-oriented design connects the public rail system, Waterfront Line, to the complex for easy access to downtown locations and the FirstEnergy Stadium, home of the Cleveland Browns football team.
Gilbane completed extensive preconstruction services which included procurement and diversity outreach, value engineering, constructability reviews, and estimating services. Diverse and small business participation goals were exceeded.
Gilbane directed construction of the Flats East Bank Development on a tight site in an urban environment with many constraints, including adjacent facilities, limited lay-down areas, and a high volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. To manage this complexity, we developed and implemented site-specific Logistics and Traffic Control Plans. To minimize disruptions to the surrounding area, Gilbane constructed a concrete Jersey barrier with a chain link fence around the construction site, and coordinated with adjacent building managers and local authorities regarding all lane closures and changes to traffic flow.
Whenever possible, Gilbane arranged for prefabrication of project components to eliminate much of the on-site work such as welding, reduce the number of workers on site, improve quality, and enhance field safety. Prefabricated items included the unitized curtain wall panels; concrete column reinforcement; large sheet metal ductwork and pipe risers; structural stud framing walls for the hotel; and others. The unitized curtain wall was prefabricated and assembled in Columbia, South America. This required close coordination of material procurement, shipping of glass tiles from the US to Columbia, fabrication, unit assembly, shipping from port to port, trucking to the jobsite, and hoisting to the building floors for installation.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/flats-east-bank-development/,"Client Name: Flats East Bank Development

"Flats East Bank Development consists of a three-story, 545-car parking garage, a 22-story office building complex to house tenants including Ernst & Young, Tucker Ellis & West, CBRE, and a six-story Aloft Hotel. Gilbane’s Cleveland District office is also headquartered in the new tower.  The transit-oriented design connects the public rail system, Waterfront Line, to the complex for easy access to downtown locations and the FirstEnergy Stadium, home of the Cleveland Browns football team.
Gilbane completed extensive preconstruction services which included procurement and diversity outreach, value engineering, constructability reviews, and estimating services. Diverse and small business participation goals were exceeded.
Gilbane directed construction of the Flats East Bank Development on a tight site in an urban environment with many constraints, including adjacent facilities, limited lay-down areas, and a high volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. To manage this complexity, we developed and implemented site-specific Logistics and Traffic Control Plans. To minimize disruptions to the surrounding area, Gilbane constructed a concrete Jersey barrier with a chain link fence around the construction site, and coordinated with adjacent building managers and local authorities regarding all lane closures and changes to traffic flow.
Whenever possible, Gilbane arranged for prefabrication of project components to eliminate much of the on-site work such as welding, reduce the number of workers on site, improve quality, and enhance field safety. Prefabricated items included the unitized curtain wall panels; concrete column reinforcement; large sheet metal ductwork and pipe risers; structural stud framing walls for the hotel; and others. The unitized curtain wall was prefabricated and assembled in Columbia, South America. This required close coordination of material procurement, shipping of glass tiles from the US to Columbia, fabrication, unit assembly, shipping from port to port, trucking to the jobsite, and hoisting to the building floors for installation.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/flats-east-bank-development/,"Client Name: Flats East Bank Development

"Located in the heart of Boston’s Innovation District, the Living Laboratory is home to Fraunhofer CSE’s Massachusetts R&D center for the advancement of sustainable energy systems. Gilbane provided construction management services for the energy-retrofit of this 100-year-old building. The first-of-its-kind Lab leverages cutting-edge design concepts and historic architecture alongside in-house research facilities, including a pilot solar module fabrication line, dedicated thermal testing laboratory, and extensive characterization/environmental testing resources.
A challenging yet rewarding aspect of the project’s construction was the integration of materials from many of the Fraunhofer CSE building technology partners. These manufacturers provided materials to be used for the project at no cost. Gilbane worked collaboratively with the architect, suppliers, and subcontractors to accurately coordinate the installation of the provided materials.
The Fraunhofer Center for Sustainable Energy Systems has achieved LEED Gold certification.   The Center features innovative insulation materials, triple-pane windows, radiant heating and cooling, displacement ventilation, and a passive chilled beams and sails HVAC system.  The project team met monthly to verify that all the necessary documentation was being kept and procedures were being followed to ensure that the desired LEED Gold Certification was achieved.

"Gilbane’s review of the initial design revealed that the cost to maintain the high rise curtainwall façade system was prohibitive. Enlisting support of architects, the curtainwall manufacturers, installers and window washer companies they worked together to create a design which balanced aesthetic objectives with functional and budget needs. The design team utilized computer generated 3D modeling to explain the solution. The modeling provided the perfect platform for the Goodyear Leadership Steering Committee to provide critical input to the project and obtain information critical for the final decision. The end result was a façade treatment that reflects both the aesthetic, functional, and budgetary needs of Goodyear and was achieved through collaboration and cooperation. The new curtainwall system met all the requirements, saved Goodyear $287,000 and provided for an economical maintenance plan.

"The H&R Block Headquarters Restack project in Kansas City, Missouri included the relocation of more than 2,350 personnel during 13 move sessions. The moves were strategically scheduled during the tax industry’s off-season, creating an extremely tight timeline for completion between May and October.
Gilbane’s TPM team worked closely with H&R Block to identify and execute a new stack and block plan that condensed the square footage of 1,200 associates’ work areas in order to accommodate five contiguous floors for the occupancy and use of a call center that employed 700 personnel.
The Transition Plan involved:
Gilbane was able to meet all existing and new project challenges by developing well planned and thought out strategies then successfully implementing them. Workstations were downsized and panels lowered to create a free-address and agile work environment.

"El Paso Corporation and owner representative, Hines, selected the Gilbane team for the complete renovation of El Paso Corporation’s 32-story headquarters in downtown Houston. The renovation of this 45 year-old, high-rise office building included the complete restacking of all departments, functions, and employee areas.
Each of the floors renovated included asbestos abatement. This process was carefully managed and secured since the building was occupied by 2,000 El Paso Corporation employees. A negative air environment during demolition ensured the safety of all workers and staff occupying the building.
A new data center was included in the project scope. The renovation also consisted of new flooring and ceilings, new MEP systems, equipment, and fixtures. Each floor has a “Town Center” lounge area boasting luxury amenities for use by employees.
Because of El Paso Corporation’s needs for immediate rearranging of the built out office and work station areas, lightweight partitions were installed to allow for ease in movement.
The Gilbane project staff took great strides to ensure a sustainable project. At 65% completion of the project, 83% of construction debris and materials had been sent for recycling.

"Mane, Inc. is a family-owned firm founded in 1871 and headquartered in Bar Sur Loup, France. They have more than 1,700 employees worldwide and are a leader in the development of flavorings and fragrances. Gilbane recently constructed a new research & development (R&D) facility, manufacturing pilot plant, and administration facility at Mane’s new U.S. headquarters campus in Lebanon, Ohio. This facility replaces their old campus in Milford, Ohio. The new campus now employs more than 200 people; 127 of which are new jobs created in Lebanon as a result of the new facility.
The two-story buildings have a structural steel frame with slab-on-metal deck system, combined with a steel framed and pre-cast deck pilot plant addition. The exterior stud frame and curtain wall feature an architectural “bubble” glass feature wall at the main entrance. In addition to multiple, multi-use lab spaces, there are many high-end items that were utilized for the fit-out, such as LED light fixtures, glass bottle windows, ornamental stairways, and an intricate, Epoxy Terrazzo floor system. The pilot plant facilitates the creation of new techniques in developing flavoring products.

"This corporate headquarters project included the construction of a four-story office building, a section of the Milwaukee Riverwalk, a 585-foot road and a seven-level parking deck with street-level retail space connected to the office building via a skywalk.
The 292,000 SF headquarters building is prominently situated along a bend in the Milwaukee River offering dramatic views of the city skyline. The building resembles a bent horseshoe with structural angles and glassworks that bracket a plaza entrance along the river. The first floor houses the lobby, client center, state-of-the-art learning center and a café. The second, third and fourth floors contain raised floor office space for ManpowerGroup and two subsidiaries, Jefferson Wells and Right Management. Outside, there is a two-story water wall at the entrance and the plaza, connected to Milwaukee’s Riverwalk and offers public access to free wireless internet.
The building’s masonry mass fills the entire site and is punctuated by windows set deep into the skin. An elegant glass and aluminum curtainwall is carved deeply into the river façade – opening the core of the office building to the city and the river. Wood resin panels provide a warm counterpoint to the glass façade along with subtle articulation along the north and west façade. Abundant glass fills the first floor height, and the rooftop terrace provides spectacular views.
The building achieved LEED-NC Gold certification. Several of the sustainable elements include: under-floor air distribution systems, daylight to 90% of the work spaces, water use reduction, water efficient landscaping, maximum construction material recycling, use of low-emitting materials, 50% of the wood used from rapidly renewable forests and access to public transportation.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/manpowergroup-world-headquarters/,"Client Name: Riverbend Place, LLC

"Located in downtown Findlay, Ohio, this 680,000 SF corporate campus required extensive coordination with multiple architects to successfully deliver multiple projects on Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s (MPC) corporate campus. Scope of work included two new parking structures, an office building and an administrative service building. Five pedestrian bridges connect the new buildings with the existing buildings on campus.

"This project consisted of renovations to the existing core and shell, as well as a 48,000 SF addition of a new wing to the Wilmington courthouse. Built in 1916, the original Wilmington courthouse was modernized and connected to the adjacent MBNA buildings via a pedestrian bridge. The integrity of the historic design elements of the building such as the shaped staircases, three-story grand foyer entrances, granite façade, dome ceilings and marble flooring was preserved. Renovations included a new roof, replacement windows, and new mechanical and electrical equipment.
In order to balance the layout of the building and increase its size, an existing addition on the south wing that housed a police station was demolished to make way for a two-story vertical expansion that mirrored the north wing. The project took up one city block in downtown Wilmington which created the need for specific and tight site logistics planning and scheduling. There were several project challenges, including no on site staging, the shutdown of access to the pedestrian bridge at 11
Street, and road closures that could only be done on the weekends due to heavy downtown traffic on weekdays.
A unique design feature of the building included the redesign of the existing front entrances to create on colonnade along King Street.

The project took up one city block in downtown Wilmington which created the need for specific and tight site logistics planning and scheduling. There were several project challenges, including no on site staging, the shutdown of access to the pedestrian bridge at 11
Street, and road closures that could only be done on the weekends due to heavy downtown traffic on weekdays.
A unique design feature of the building included the redesign of the existing front entrances to create on colonnade along King Street. The rejuvenation and expansion of the building ensured a refreshed space for MBNA to prepare for future growth.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/mbna-america-1000-north-king-street/,"Client Name: MBNA America (now Bank of America)

"Gilbane Building Company provided general contracting services for a confidential client for their Chicago office at 500 W Madison. Gilbane completed the original buildout for the client in 2015 and was brought back in 2017 to reconfigure the entire floor for a new subtenant. Once the demising project was completed for the client, their tenant hired Gilbane to complete the renovation of their new 17,000 SF space in order to fit their needs.
Scope of work for the confidential client consisted of interior demolition, drywall partitions with security fencing above ceilings, existing acoustical ceilings and flooring rework, new door assemblies with security access, existing MEPFP system reconfiguration based on revised layout and building landlord requirements, as well as above ceiling LV conduit/junction boxes per the client’s security requirements. The tenant’s project required minor demolition to expand the existing employee breakroom and new walls to create a large conference room.  The remaining scope required rework and patching of existing walls, ceilings, flooring and MEPFP systems.
Since the project included renovation of an occupied existing space, one unique challenge was the need to match all new finishes in the tenant’s space to the existing materials including cloud/acoustical ceiling, carpet and tile. The vinyl plank flooring in the existing space was discontinued after the original project was completed in 2015. Gilbane’s project manager was able to source the material from a warehouse on the east coast to ensure a seamless and cohesive final product.

"Phillips 66 hired Gilbane to take over construction phase services as the General Contractor for their Headquarters project that was already underway. The new corporate campus is 2 million+ SF and accommodates approximately 1,800 employees. The project is on 14 acres and encompasses multiple buildings, including 14-story and 16-story office towers and a parking garage.
Each tower is equipped with raised access flooring on each level and includes demountable partition offices to allow for maximum flexibility of the space and ease of maintenance. The executive center in the South Tower features a large stairway, board room, executive suites and executive conferencing.
The project was targeting LEED Silver Certification but surpassed the necessary points and is awaiting final LEED review. Sustainable features include the unitized curtain wall system, which was prefabricated as modular units off-site. Other features include energy efficient MEP systems and use of regional materials – also much of the construction waste was recycled.
The enclosure system balances the need for daylight and views with the need to provide a highly effective enclosure system that reduces the high cooling load of the Houston environment. Stone walls at the base of the building are highly insulated. High performance glass is utilized in the curtain wall system along with exterior shading devices.

The Design Architect, Backen, Gillam & Kroeger Architects, designed it as a “contemporary” Southern estate with high-scale Venetian-style plaster featuring two acres of gardens and terraces, granite courtyards and fountains, a 50-foot reflecting pool, an outdoor fireplace, and an 8,000 SF rooftop park and conservatory with views of the Atlanta skyline. Inside you’ll find a large atrium; a grand, 6-story, and steel staircase.
With the extremely tight sight conditions and an aggressive schedule that had to meet the required grand opening date, Gilbane had a challenging project on its hands. The project’s tight schedule mandated that conflict resolution happen within a matter of hours or minutes, instead of days, therefore the team utilized live meeting technology to collaborate. The project’s wide-ranging changes created numerous utility conflicts, such as storm and sanitary lines, that ran underneath the site.
Gilbane met with the subcontractor, who hired a survey crew, to determine and verify any utility conflicts. Each time the task was complete, the owner, design team, and Gilbane held immediate online meetings or conference calls to decide a path forward. Additionally 20 RH visual artists and nearly 70 tradesmen were needed to merchandise the store. In order to meet the finish store opening date of Black Friday the team worked around-the-clock shifts three weeks prior to the store’s opening.

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for San Felipe Place, a new 17-story “boutique” office tower designed by HKS Architects. Owned and managed by Hines Corporation, the structure includes eight levels for parking and nine floors of premier office space. The building provides local tenants with the most convenient and comprehensive work environment available.
Because of its close proximity to residential areas, the building was specially designed to be compatible in both neighborhood and commercial settings. The parking 400-space parking garage, measuring 160,000 SF, is enclosed with opaque spandrel hand vision glass so cars aren’t visible from the exterior. In addition to a main lobby, bank, and coffee shop, San Felipe Place contains 173,000 SF of office space including two floors of executive suites and six elevators. Mechanical equipment is situated in a sound-proof enclosure on the roof.
Sidewalks shaded by trees border the building and underground detention systems will be put in place to safely manage rainwater. Workers were required to park offsite and travel in by shuttle to decrease congestion throughout construction.
Targeting LEED Gold certification, the project recycled 76% of construction debris and employs green building design, operations, and maintenance solutions. Furthermore, San Felipe Place benefited from Gilbane’s Building Information Modeling (BIM) services which increased collaboration, improved safety, accelerated processes, and reduced costs. After conducting thorough document and design review, Gilbane had already addressed several issues which would have added weeks to the schedule and thousands of dollars in construction changes had they not been resolved in the design phase.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/san-felipe-place/,"Client Name: Hines Corporation

"The new, three-floor, 183,000 SF, $15 million fast-track interior build-out for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Headquarters relocation features a “wildlife theme” which incorporates animal accents throughout the space. The space is also divided into “biomes” which include different elements of each of the five major biomes found throughout the world.
The major challenge associated with interiors project was the tight time-frame and aggressive schedule. All three floors were completed within a 12-week schedule, and required a work load of 6 days a week, ten hours a day. The project includes lobbies, copy/pantry areas, huddle rooms, offices, conference rooms, a waiting area, elevator lobbies, a welcome center, and a café.  Due to the security requirements for this
, secure bullet proof spaces were installed. The conference rooms are equipped with four Skyfold partitions, an Italian de-mountable partition and a conference center with 12’ high ceilings. Other significant features include the high-end light fixtures throughout as well as an extensive glass package. The glass package includes glass fronts for the offices and huddle rooms and a telescoping wall in the conference room, enabling the doors to open simultaneously.
The “biomes” include features such as custom vinyl film, in a variety of animal shapes and scenery, placed over office walls. Elevator lobbies will also incorporate the “wildlife theme” by featuring laser printed animals on the wood panels, which line the elevator lobbies.

This collaboration was so successful that is has become a point of inspiration for Gilbane’s work in the Higher Education market sector.
Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for California State University’s new Associated Students Sustainability Center. The facility is home to the Institute for Sustainability and is intended to serve as an example of energy efficiency and sustainable design. The project features a seminar room, a conference room, student workspace, a lounge, a community resource center, restrooms and a 5,000 SF covered courtyard which will both house equipment for recycling and serve as the rooftop structure for a 25kw photovoltaic system with approximately 100 solar panels.
The building envelope is high performance, including glazing systems, enhanced insulation, durable and sustainable cladding, cool or green roof systems, and daylighting throughout the complex. The landscape is drought tolerant and includes a bioswale. A graywater system connected to onsite showers and lavatories is being used for irrigation; a solar thermal hot water system and vacuum composting toilets have also been incorporated into the project.
The Center has achieved LEED Platinum certification and is targeting Living Building Challenge certification; and is also seeking both Net-Zero Energy and Net-Zero Water certifications.

"Located in downtown Cleveland, the new facility includes fitness and weight room areas, three basketball courts, racquetball courts, a 1/10-mile track, juice bar, administrative areas, and an underground parking garage. In addition, provisions were made for a pedestrian bridge which connects the facility to a 400-car parking garage.
Constructed on a tight, urban site while sharing a wall with the adjacent operational natatorium, the project team was challenged with minimal laydown areas and vibration control. Due to this, site organization and communication with the University was critical to accommodate contractor trailers and equipment while preventing disruption to nearby academic and residential buildings. Student, faculty, visitor, and trade contractor safety was a key component to the success of the new recreation center.
As Cleveland State’s first LEED building, the project achieved LEED-NC Silver Certification.

The second floor has a landscaped outdoor terrace with a “green” (living plants) wall. The roof level contains a future astronomy lab and the penthouse. The building shape is a long and slender rectangle (474’ x 120’ foot print) with the long axis running east-west. The design allows natural light into the lab classrooms. Brick with bands of cast stone and metal panels complete the exterior skin. Over the lobby and science corner there are 18 light monitors/ skylights. The light monitors use steel tubes and translucent insulated panels to permit light into the building while blocking direct sunlight from entering the building.
The Central Plant work included a 10,660 SF addition to the existing plant which created a new heating plant of 3,800 SF and a shell space of 6,860 SF for future Richland College facilities offices.

"Duke University selected Gilbane to provide construction management at risk services for the new Student Wellness Center. The three-story, 72,000 SF building is designed to bring together the University wellness services and resources under one roof to create a holistic and integrated approach to individual wellness.
The complex facility was designed and built to create a space where students and community members can focus on their individual wellness by looking at the integration of many areas of their life including financial, social, spiritual, intellectual, mind-body well-being and the environment around them. The modern building is warm and inviting and offers more open features that are less clinical in nature. The design brings the outside inside with views of the Duke Forest and use of natural wood incorporated into the furniture and wall panels that was locally sourced from the trees removed from the site during construction. The facility was designed to be a place for healing centered around well-being and the use of a glue laminated (glulam) structure represented an extension of the forest behind it.
Before construction began, an impact study was conducted to determine how to maximize the amount of forest that could be saved around the construction project. Select trees were then removed from the site to create just enough space to build the new facility. Those trees were then reclaimed and reintegrated into the building through use in wood veneer for furniture, decorative wood wall paneling and whole-tree benches. The wood wall paneling along each story of the atrium depicts an image of the forest with the first floor image showing the forest at floor level and the third floor showing the tops of the trees. Plaques throughout the building provide an education opportunity with information about the reclaimed wood and the forest outside.

"The Master Plan Implementation project consisted of three dormitory buildings, including the transformation of an existing Jesuit Residence to a 140-bed upper classman dormitory, construction of a new 135-bed under classman dormitory, and a new upper classman 190-bed apartment style dormitory. The projects were managed by separate Gilbane teams under a single contract involving multiple architects, design consultants, and trade contractors.
Two of the dormitories were designed and constructed to meet LEED® Silver requirements and one dormitory features a green/vegetative roof. The entire program exceeded the 75 percent construction waste recycling requirements. Two of the three projects encompassed construction activities adjacent to fully occupied dormitories, requiring exceptional dedication to working collaboratively with the university to ensure safety and minimize disruption. Upon performing exploratory demolition on one of the dormitories, it was discovered that much of the existing envelope elements needed to be replaced. Despite doubling the initial scope of work on a five month renovation, the original project’s completion date was met.

"The Van Leer IDC project had an incredible mission to foster design, creativity, innovation, and invention for students at Georgia Tech and serve as a “visible sign that design/engineering is a profession committed to the betterment of humanity.” Students from all disciplines utilize the space to invent and test their ideas.
Gilbane utilized green building strategies to deliver the Van Leer Interdisciplinary Design Commons in Atlanta, Georgia. The 15,600-square-foot renovation transformed a two-story rotunda and auditorium into a three-level collaborative workplace. The facility includes four major components:
The design/collaboration area houses a computer lab, project room, conference room, and lounge space. Fabrication areas comprise a water jet lab, electronics lab, wood shop, machine shop, and wet lab. Support features state-of-the-art computing and simulation tools, such as 3D printers, a drill press and high-powered lasers.
Located in the center of campus, another component of the program is a signature outdoor amenity that functions as an extension of Tech Green, as well as, the exterior extension of the IDC. It is imagined as a place for testing and having a connection to the IDC programmatically and visually.
Site work and improvements included demolishing the existing space and installing new hardscape/landscape and reworking existing and installing new underground utilities for the Plaza. The IDC’s structure and façade has new openings to introduce natural light through windows and window shading, removal of the existing CMU and replacing with brick façade creating a new third floor of structural steel, and monumental staircase.

"The Academic Center is a four-story building that consists of offices, chemistry and cosmetology labs, a Barnes and Noble bookstore and numerous classrooms. The building features a state-of-the-art communications systems and its South elevation is adorned by a contemporary sun shade system.
Utilizing both parts of the existing Northline Mall and parking lot for this campus, the project made a tremendous impact on the community. On the first day of class, they were already at full capacity.
This building was the first of many planned for the brand new inner-city college campus. This signature building stood alone for just a short time and was soon surrounded by additional buildings as the planned campus took shape.

"The Academic Center is a four-story building that consists of offices, chemistry and cosmetology labs, a Barnes and Noble bookstore and numerous classrooms. The building features a state-of-the-art communications systems and its South elevation is adorned by a contemporary sun shade system.
Utilizing both parts of the existing Northline Mall and parking lot for this campus, the project made a tremendous impact on the community. On the first day of class, they were already at full capacity.
This building was the first of many planned for the brand new inner-city college campus. This signature building stood alone for just a short time and was soon surrounded by additional buildings as the planned campus took shape.

"The Third Floor Science Hall Renovation at Lakeland Community College totaled 32,600 SF and was performed over three separate fast-track phases. Each phase was completed over the summer months on 69-day schedules to ensure classrooms were ready for fall classes. The renovation to transform the third floor took place in several academic settings such as chemistry and biology laboratories, anatomy and physiology laboratories, student lounges and several prep rooms for faculty. A new planetarium was installed in one of the classrooms as well.
Material management planning was paramount during each phase of the renovation. With limited laydown areas and no freight elevators, the project team communicated with all user groups to successfully plan how materials were entering and exiting the third floor of the building. Prefabrication and long-lead item management were critical to implement ensure the short schedules were kept on track.
In order for the project to be completed before students returned in the fall, contractors worked multiple shifts during each the three-month, fast-track schedule. Although it was summer, work was phased to prevent disruptions to ongoing academic and administrative activities occurring in the building. The project was completed on schedule and ready for the first day of classes after each phase, with no lost time accidents through the duration of the project.

"Gilbane provided construction management at-risk services for the historical renovation of the 73,300 SF Pomerene Hall and 30,765 SF Oxley Hall on the main campus of The Ohio State University.
Pomerene Hall is a three-story plus basement, brick Jacobethan Revival-style building constructed in 1922. It was originally built to function as the women’s student union. Oxley Hall is a three-story plus basement, brick English Renaissance-style building constructed in 1908 and was the first women’s dormitory on campus. The two buildings were renovated as one phased project to house the University’s data analytics program. Data analytics is a new, interdisciplinary major in the College of Arts and Sciences and one of the first of its kind in the country to introduce students to a fast-growing field with data at its core. Renovated space included faculty and staff offices, conference/meeting rooms, classrooms, computer labs, data storage and support areas. A third component of this project was the enabling project to renovate 18,200 SF of space in Baker Commons. This space now houses the Office of Disability Services as they moved out of Pomerene Hall. Baker Commons is a two-story dining facility addition to the Baker Hall student residence building, constructed in 1958. Challenges associated with this project included tying into existing systems, tight site logistics on an active campus and the complex historical renovation of Pomerene Hall.
The project required a large demolition, addition and renovation to Pomerene Hall, the most complex building of the overall project. It was the intent of the team to retain as much of the original 1900s historical character as possible.

"Rice University’s Brockman Hall for Physics is a state-of-the-art, Advanced Physics research facility. The facility features complex mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems with a strong emphasis on sound, electrical harmonics, and vibration elimination. This hyper-track project was completed on time and within budget through the teamwork and cooperation of everyone involved. This facility is comprised of one lecture hall, six classrooms, advanced experimental space, research laboratories, offices, and equipment for researchers.
The labs are supplied with clean electrical power, chilled water to cool lasers, and filtered air that is cleansed of submicroscopic dust. The building’s entrance showcases intricate German terracotta lattice system that serves as a decorative feature and shade for corresponding interior rooms. Another innovative feature is the dichroic glass wall by the building’s main staircase. The fourth floor mechanical space houses an energy recovery system, the largest in a single air unit in Texas, which saves 30% of the energy needed to cool the building. Furthermore, the complex dehumidification system has the capacity of returning 100,000 gallons of pure, clean water to Rice’s central plant annually.
The facility accommodates the current and projected growth needs of the Natural Sciences Department of the University. Brockman Hall conveys a new image on the Rice University’s campus in the form of its design. That innovation is complementary for the work performed inside of the facility, as it allows scientists to perform more advanced and precise research that will benefit both the University and the science community as a whole.

"Led by Gilbane Building Company, the new Patricia R. Guerrieri Academic Commons at Salisbury University spans over 220,000 SF and was delivered via a design-build with a GMP delivery method utilizing design assist subcontractors. Designed in Revit, BIM was an integral part of both the design and construction phases. The structure features a bell tower and is now the University’s most prominent building, located in the middle of the campus with direct visibility from Route 13. Certified LEED Gold, the four-story structure features a partial basement, green roof, traditional brick façade, stone and curtainwall entrance and punch windows.
The project included an ‘early package’ consisting of hazmat abatement, demolition, site work and utility location. The steel-framed structure sits on an auger cast pile foundation system. The partial basement houses mechanical spaces and storage for facilities, housekeeping and FF&E. The ground floor features a prominent four-story atrium, student academic commons, computer instructional labs, café with complete kitchen and servery, loading dock and back of the house support spaces. The second level includes math and computer instructional labs, classrooms, group study spaces, faculty offices, tutorial spaces, café seating, studio and presentation instructional rooms.
Level three features traditional library ‘stacks’ housing collections, periodicals, government documents and reading rooms. The fourth floor houses special collections, archives and lab preservation rooms, an over 700-person special events room with exterior balcony and 125-person board room.

"Gilbane is providing comprehensive Program Management and Construction Management services for the San Jose Evergreen Community College District (SJECCD). The District includes two distinct college campuses which serve more than 22,000 students with more than 720,000square feet of educational and support facilities.
Gilbane’s responsibilities include the completion of San Jose City College’s masterplan and the continued expansion, renovation and repair of Evergreen Valley College which involve more than 15 projects per campus as well as several District-wide facilities-related initiatives. All capital construction projects are primarily funded by bond measure G (2004) and/or measure G (2010). All projects are targeting LEED Silver certification.
As the program/construction manager, one of our primary initial responsibilities was to ensure compliance by keeping bond finance tracking and reporting functions separate between the two bond measures. Gilbane and its partners have worked to establish industry-leading program protocols, procedures, roles and responsibilities as well as reporting tools and financial management services. In addition to providing all industry-standard program and construction management services, Gilbane has led communications and PR-related services to fully support the District with its Board of Trustees and Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee reporting requirements. Gilbane further interacts closely with the local architectural, engineering and vendor community on behalf of the District, and has established new design and contractor procurement methods intended to further enhance process transparency.

"The State University of New York at Potsdam Performing Arts Center is the College’s dance and theater students’ first purpose-built space. And, it’s the first new building on the campus since the 1970’s.

"Construction was divided into three phases due to the project’s enormous scale and complexity, as well as to minimize disruption to academic operations. Phase1 included an off-site Adventure Recreation Center; Phase 2 included the Recreation Center/Natatorium and a 1,000-car parking structure; and Phase 3 included the Physical Activities & Education Services building.
Totaling 650,000 SF, the complex includes a seven pool aquatic center, basketball, volleyball, badminton, racquetball and squash courts, more than 27,500 SF fitness and conditioning space, student wellness center, synthetic turf gymnasium, as well as a climbing wall and outdoor adventure center.
The world-class facility is the result of Antoine Predock’s vision and compilation of abstract shapes into a formidable design that is at the heart of the OSU student wellness program. Early in design, Predock’s team sculpted numerous clay models to communicate his vision to OSU and the construction team. With an intense focus on contemporary design blended with functionality for the students, the design team of Predock and Moody Nolan incorporated over $8 million in architectural concrete, expansive use of exposed structural steel, AESS and ornamental metals, and more than 10 different glass types to achieve the intended design.

"With Gilbane as their partner, the University embarked on two new projects that were critical components of their capital improvement master plan. The goal of the project was to maintain the University’s rich architectural heritage and ensure the campus was integrated into the surrounding community.
The project consisted of an 811-bed residence hall with single-, double- and apartment-style suites in one high-rise and two mid-rise buildings; a 539-seat dining facility including a 75- to 85-seat café; convenience store; and study commons with computer facilities and study space for the complex. The residence halls consist of a series of wings, ranging in height from five to nine stories, arranged around two private courtyards.

Extensive summer renovation work, supported by a detailed buy-out schedule and on-site storage of construction materials, was conducted to meet the critical completion milestone coinciding with the start of the academic school year and the return of students to campus.

"With Gilbane as their partner, the University embarked on two new projects that were critical components of their capital improvement master plan. The goal of the project was to maintain the University’s rich architectural heritage and ensure the campus was integrated into the surrounding community.
The project consisted of an 811-bed residence hall with single-, double- and apartment-style suites in one high-rise and two mid-rise buildings; a 539-seat dining facility including a 75- to 85-seat café; convenience store; and study commons with computer facilities and study space for the complex. The residence halls consist of a series of wings, ranging in height from five to nine stories, arranged around two private courtyards.

"This new 220,478-square-foot complex building provides some of the nation’s most advanced facilities, including clean rooms for nanotechnology work, micro-electro-mechanical labs, immersive virtual reality and ultra high-definition digital cinema.
The facility includes research neighborhoods, specialized labs, general and public spaces and administrative offices. Specialized labs included two class-100 lithographyan rooms and a nanoscale fabrication laboratory. The complex accommodates a 3-D scanning lab, two metrology labs, two metalization/thin film deposition labs, a back-end processing lab, wet processing lab, femto laser lab, and a SIMS laboratory. Researchers study virtual reality, specialized audio, advanced audio and video synthesis, motion capture, streaming media, and interactive, distributed performance. Additional features included a 200-seat auditorium, 2,000-square-foot multi-function exhibit gallery, and an audio/video lab.
The Gilbane team assessed a unique challenge early in the process of this facility by discovering that an ordinary metal and glass interfered with wireless signals, which is critical to the functionalities of this research building. The Gilbane team researched to find a composite material called Trespa that could be used on the exterior of the building that minimizes blocking of electromagnetic waves and allows the building’s steel structural system to map interference points, thereby allowing the researchers the ability to conduct their work as they had intended.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/university-california-san-diego-cal-it2-facility-richard-c-atkinson-hall/,"Client Name: University of California, San Diego

"The new 226,000 SF, eight-story Brehm Center expansion houses clinical and surgery space for the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and space for the Brehm Center for Type 1 Diabetes Research and Analysis. The building has large windows and a full wall of glass panels on the building’s façade, allowing for more natural light in the clinical and patient space. The new facility has a similar exterior to that of the existing building, adjoining the two separate buildings and creating a unified and seamless exterior.

The new facility also mirrors the existing building on the interior. All laboratory space on the upper floors is the same in both buildings. This intelligent design allows researchers in the existing building to work cohesively with their counterparts in the new Brehm Center, saving time and improving collaboration. The lower patient floors operate in the same way, which provides easier way-finding for patients and staff.

Clinical spaces accommodate patient education and provide comfortable waiting areas designed to improve patient flow. Space has also been allocated for genetic testing so patients with serious eye disorders can learn if their children or other family members carry the gene for the same disease. The facility also provides genetic counseling services to assist patients in understanding the uses and implications of genetic testing.
Research space features an open laboratory layout, encouraging collaboration between researchers working on different floors. On the fifth and sixth floor, research space includes a laboratory with strategy space right outside the lab for discussion and planning purposes.

As one of the oldest buildings on campus, structural upgrades on Lincoln Hall brought the facility into compliance with mechanical, plumbing, fire, and seismic safety standards.

"Gilbane performed Construction Manager at Risk Services on the University of Nevada Reno’s Chilled Water System Upgrade.  The overall goal of the project was to consolidate the existing individual chilled water systems into one cohesive unit.  This entailed the installation of new underground supply and return lines and converting 19 existing buildings’ chilled water systems into one centrally located MCP “Modular Chiller Unit”.  Most of the existing cooling systems had to be completely removed and replaced with new controls, DP sensors and modulating valves that would be sequenced using cutting-edge technology accessible from any part of campus.
The overall goal of the utilities upgrade would be to eliminate 70% of the energy needed to cool the buildings, while maintaining the overall system functions.  This presented some challenges for the team considering the age of some of the buildings and utilities on campus some of which were constructed at the turn of the last century.

"Gilbane provided design phase and construction management services for the new University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center George and Cynthia Mitchell Basic Sciences Research Building. This project consisted of a completely new research facility which replaced an existing research laboratory and vivarium space used by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The facility accommodates both the Cancer Center and The University of Texas Health Science Center- Houston Research.
The 890,000 SF Basic Sciences Research Building features two floors of vivarium space and six floors of research laboratories. In addition to the vivarium and research laboratories, other components of the building include office space, graduate school of biomedical sciences, conference rooms, public lobby/gallery and building support space.

"Gilbane completed the renovation of three buildings on the San Antonio 1604 Campus. The buildings include the Science building, Life Sciences Laboratory (LSL), and the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL). The LSL and PSL were complete interior demolition and replacement projects. Both laboratory buildings are now supported by a new central plant. The Science building includes a new fire sprinkler system and life safety upgrades. The renovations were completed in a fully occupied building.
These projects presented a challenge due to work being performed in occupied facilities with ongoing operations. The existing Science Building was an extremely busy building with full occupancy all day and partial occupancy until late in the night. Gilbane worked closely with the UTSA campus personnel to understand the buildings’ schedules on a day to day basis and plan major work activities for better access times such as semester breaks and holidays utilizing a complete night shift operation at the Science Building project to minimize the impact to the daily users. Materials were delivered at night as there is no laydown space available around the building; all materials went into the work area when they were offloaded.

The buildings include the Science building, Life Sciences Laboratory (LSL), and the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL). The LSL and PSL were complete interior demolition and replacement projects. Both laboratory buildings are now supported by a new central plant. The Science building includes a new fire sprinkler system and life safety upgrades. The renovations were completed in a fully occupied building.
These projects presented a challenge due to work being performed in occupied facilities with ongoing operations. The existing Science Building was an extremely busy building with full occupancy all day and partial occupancy until late in the night. Gilbane worked closely with the UTSA campus personnel to understand the buildings’ schedules on a day to day basis and plan major work activities for better access times such as semester breaks and holidays utilizing a complete night shift operation at the Science Building project to minimize the impact to the daily users. Materials were delivered at night as there is no laydown space available around the building; all materials went into the work area when they were offloaded. Successfully working in an occupied facility requires detailed planning and most importantly continual communication.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/university-texas-san-antonio-combined-science/,"Client Name: The University of Texas System

"Gilbane served as construction manager for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas’s (UTSWMC) new biotechnology building project.
UTSWMC’s “BioCenter at Southwestern Medical District” supports the technology transfer efforts of the “Office of Technology Development.” The University required a high degree of flexibility in the design of this field of dreams project to accommodate a variety of Biotechnology enterprises.
The facility provides lease space for start-up ventures to serve the spectrum of the biotechnology and biomedical device industry. The sixteen foot floor-to-floor height and integrally designed mechanical penthouse allows for the distribution of utilities above ceilings to maximize usable square footage. This design allows any available square foot to be used for either laboratory or office space.
The building’s exterior materials are in keeping with the contextual vocabulary of the existing UTSWMC campus. Sustainably designed, while not submitted for certification, the project could potentially obtain LEED® Silver status. Ample fenestration using highly efficient insulated glazing accommodates daylighting of the interior and visual connectivity of the occupants to the environment. Collaborative spaces, the large break area and vertical circulation lobby for instance, are located along the transept circulation corridor to enhance purposeful and chance meetings of researchers. The interior finishes, selected for aesthetics and durability, work with the spatial experience to promote an inspirational environment; witness this in the relation of three story reception lobby to the transept circulation corridor.
The flexibility of the building both in programmatic function and mechanical systems provides for the rapid fit up or renovation of spaces to accommodate new users. The laboratory module is conservatively established to provide anywhere from 363 square foot labs with ample bench space to as much as 35,000 square feet of contiguous laboratory space. From the structural grid to the exterior glazing the dimensional control is a reflection of the laboratory module. The wide main corridor and abundantly sized dual purpose service/occupant only elevator allows for secure equipment move-in without impairment to personnel circulation. The routing of utilities overhead rather than in a service corridor maximizes the usable square footage; which in turn reduces lease rates. The functional flexibility of the building can support both the wet and dry sciences and any given non-support square foot can be any configuration of laboratory or office and the distribution of looped utility, air and exhaust systems can be easily configured or reconfigured to accommodate the high churn rate generally experienced by a facility with this purpose.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-at-dallas-biotechnology-development-complex-phase-1/,"Client Name: The University of Texas

"The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) School of Business and Engineering facility covers nearly a city block in downtown Richmond Virginia and serves as the premier facility for VCU’s Business and Engineering schools. The crowded project site presented many challenges for the project team. Several large, existing structures, including a service station, had to be demolished prior to excavations; nearly all of the buildings contained significant amounts of hazardous materials, such as asbestos, that required professional treatment prior to demolition. The preliminary subsurface investigation detected large amounts of containments present in the soils; coupled with a high water table, large site dewatering system and water treatment facility were required to purge as much contamination from the soil as possible prior to construction. Due to the overall poor quality of the soils, massive undercuts, some over 14’ deep, were required to obtain the necessary bearing capacities.

In order to address neighbors’ concerns, the building was turned inward away from homes located on Campus Road. Additionally, the site underwent extensive landscaping to protect privacy and facilitate noise protection.

"Gilbane served as the construction manager at-risk, providing preconstruction and construction services for the new 102,000-square-foot, 800-student elementary school in Cary, North Carolina. The new two-story school encompasses more than 52 classrooms, kitchen and dining areas, multi-purpose room, media center and music and arts wing.
The new building is load bearing masonry construction with brick veneer, aluminum windows, canopies, flat and sloped roofing, typical school finishes, hydraulic elevator, and complete sprinkler, MEP, and low-voltage systems including emergency power. The sitework included approximately 18 acres of site development including all applicable utilities and offsite roadway improvements and roadway widening.

"Gilbane served as the construction manager at-risk, providing preconstruction and construction services for the new 102,000-square-foot, 800-student elementary school in Cary, North Carolina. The new two-story school encompasses more than 52 classrooms, kitchen and dining areas, multi-purpose room, media center and music and arts wing.
The new building is load bearing masonry construction with brick veneer, aluminum windows, canopies, flat and sloped roofing, typical school finishes, hydraulic elevator, and complete sprinkler, MEP, and low-voltage systems including emergency power. The sitework included approximately 18 acres of site development including all applicable utilities and offsite roadway improvements and roadway widening.
Wake County Public School System and Gilbane|RBI actively identified Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (MWBE) to participate in all aspects of the Wake County construction program and the team achieved 40 percent participation on this project. Gilbane and Right Build International have a long-standing commitment to maximizing HUB participation on projects.

"Gilbane is providing construction management at-risk services for the construction of the four-story, 78,000 SF New Academic Building. The .8-acre site is located at the center of the active urban campus, nestled in between Watson Hall and the Nelson Recreation Center in Boston.
As the first new academic facility on the Wentworth campus in over 40 years, the new facility will support growth and facilitate a collaborative approach to learning in a multi-disciplined academic environment. The facility is designed to meet the “next evolution” of higher education and includes four levels of academic space, as well as shared gallery and presentation space, a lecture hall, manufacturing laboratories, classrooms and offices. The facility will feature state-of-the-art equipment, technical labs and maker space with an open layout for learning and collaborative spaces. The first floor will consist of a lobby, as well as gathering and presentation spaces.
To foster collaboration, the design incorporates significant daylighting into the main areas and laboratories through the use of large windows and encouraging interactivity between the lab spaces and the streetscape. The building’s compelling façade features large scale glass and aluminum curtainwall system with zinc panels. As no new parking is included, the facility will encourage alternative transportation with a 100-space covered bike parking structure.

"Gilbane has provided comprehensive construction management and as-needed program management services to the West Valley-Mission Community College District across two bond measures – H, passed in November 2004, and C, passed in June 2012. These measures have funded the seamless delivery of both facility renovation/upgrades and capital new construction. The District prides itself in the lead delivery of program and construction management services and has accomplished significant projects and innovative delivery methods as a result.
Program highlights include an overall transformation and new orientation of the Santa Clara based Mission College campus with state of the art classroom, student services and administrative facilities. Demolition of the old administration building is slated as phase one of a future bond. In Saratoga, West Valley College has been enhanced by projects such as the Aquatic Center and Fox Center; the renovation and expansion of the Math and Science Building and Language Arts as well as various classroom upgrades and renovation of the Applied Arts & Sciences building.
As part of the District’s commitment to sustainability, the Gary G. Gillmor and Family Academic Center at Mission College achieved LEED Gold certification and West Valley College’s Language Arts & Social Sciences Building achieved LEED Silver certification.

"In order to provide ongoing functionality of the University’s Science Curriculum, construction was divided into two (2) phases. Phase 1, the new 65,000 SF Science Building with greenhouse, was ready for occupancy by the summer of 2010. Following the transition of the existing building’s occupants into the new Science Building, Phase 2 included the of renovation 165,000 SF  to the original home of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and College of Science and Health completed in time for the opening of the 2011-2012 academic year. The new facilities house state-of-the-art modular research laboratories and teaching labs designed to encourage research collaboration between faculty and students. Studies include:
The architect, HOK of New York, designed the new and old facilities to merge with the existing facility, which received a complete facade upgrade with insulated curtainwall. The project required deep foundation work of 30 to 40 feet excavations near existing structures. This site work was scheduled around special needs students to maintain access without class rescheduling. The logistics of the existing building due to the site slope has ground access at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors.
Construction was completed while the existing building was occupied; this work consisted of two lecture halls, four classrooms, upgrades to two air handlers and five boilers for the entire building. Careful planning and execution was pertinent to the successful implementation of the work that was done in the occupied area to ensure that the day-to-day activities were not interrupted.",https://www.gilbaneco.com/project/william-paterson-university-science-hall/,"Client Name: William Paterson University

"East Hall was designed to give upperclassmen a compelling reason to stay on campus, which in turn benefits the university with the leadership, mentorship, experience and talent of its students being part of the residential community. The new living/learning facility contains modern four-person apartments that include all of the amenities of independent living and a 198-vehicle parking garage.
A key challenge was the aggressive construction program implemented by the owner.

"Gilbane added to its history with WPI by building the new four-story LEED-NC Gold facility that includes a competition swimming/diving pool, multi-use courts, fitness center, running track and dance space. The center presented some geotechnical and structural challenges. For one, the building was built into a 30-foot hill. Also the design called for the gymnasium to be built on top of the competition swimming pool. To solve these critical issues, Gilbane’s team provided innovative solutions like geopiers and specialized steel arches to make adjustments during the design phase and avoid costly construction changes.
