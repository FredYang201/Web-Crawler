Along with the repair and renovation of the building’s signature lobby, we transformed the former service courtyard behind the building into a lushly planted sculpture garden and dining area for two high-end restaurants that will occupy the ground floor retail spaces. Further amenities include extensive employee bike parking and showers, a restored historic central stair for tenant circulation, and the re-use of historic wood doors throughout the building. The new garden and outdoor dining areas, community-serving retail along the street frontages, and new exterior entries and lighting provide a visible and welcoming presence both night and day, on the street, in the neighborhood, and in the city.\\nThe centerpiece of the renovation is the development of a highly flexible office floor plan. By reworking the building cores, reducing the number of elevators by providing destination control, and maintaining the historic central stair, we have maximized access to light, air, and views and provided flexibility for a variety of office layouts.
