Wallpaper named it one of the \\ntop buildings that shaped the world’s culture\\n in 2017.\\xa0\\nConventional retractable roofs feature utilitarian, sliding panels. For the design of Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the team found inspiration in the way sunlight passes through the oculus in the roof of the Pantheon in Rome. Made up of eight triangular ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) “petals” that move together along 16 individual tracks, the semi-transparent roof opens and closes like the aperture of a camera.\\nAs a continuation of the roof, the ETFE facade features angular, wing-like exterior sections. The transparency creates a 16-story “window to the city” that draws in daylight and offers panoramic views of Atlanta’s skyline.\\nWrapping the perimeter of the oval-shaped roof is a high-definition, 360-degree halo video board that gives fans an immersive, theater-in-the round experience. The one-of-a-kind video board is the largest in any of the world’s stadiums (nearly six stories high and 1,075-feet around) and provides clear views from every seat while preserving the beauty of the roof. An additional video display—a 100-foot-high mega column—is wrapped with a 3-D video board, and there are 2,000 TVs throughout the venue. More than 4,000 miles of integrated fiber-optic cable supports the technology-driven, interactive game-day experience inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium\\nA wide variety of seating options provide fans with different ticket prices, vantage points and levels of service. Amenities include a technology lounge and the 100 Yard Club, a row of concession stands that is bookended by bars and that stretches as long as the field itself.\\nThe stadium can be easily reconfigured to accommodate games for the Falcons, Atlanta United and world-class events including the Super Bowl, NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Four and major concerts. Retractable seats surrounding the field and a motorized curtain system help soccer fans get close to the action. An entirely digital stadium platform creates opportunities to display custom content for each event.\\nDesigned for sustainability, Mercedes-Benz Stadium is North America’s first \\nLEED Platinum professional sports stadium\\n. A 600,000-square-foot cistern helps recapture and reuse rainwater. This helps protect the neighborhood from flooding and provides rainwater to irrigate trees throughout the city. The site has more than 4,000 solar PV panels. The focus on sustainability extends into the community through connections to public transit and the creation of urban farming areas and open recreation spaces.\\nIn addition to serving as an anchor for the downtown tourist and entertainment district, the stadium will catalyze changes in surrounding neighborhoods. District-scale thinking enables the building to share resources with nearby developments.\\nHOK collaborated on the design with tvsdesign, Goode Van Slyke Architecture and Stanley Beaman & Sears.

Transparent ground-level spaces seamlessly connect the buildings to a new east-west linear park with plazas and gardens open to LG’s employees and the community so they appear to grow out of the landscape. This is especially evident at the lower level canteen and dining halls, which captivate guests with their access to natural light and garden views.\\nThough the campus is unified, every component is distinct. Each LG business group has its own main entrance and lobby. Natural stone frames the building elevations, which are in-filled with glass panels. This creates a variety of façade treatments that minimize heat gain and facilitate views to neighboring parks.\\nBuilding materials, which are as classic and durable as LG’s consumer products, include glazing, natural stone cladding and aluminum mullions.

The light-filled interiors continue up through each floor’s sky lobbies and primary circulation areas. Within the main lobby, a dramatic staircase invites guests up to a second-story, living room-like space with quiet zones, lounges and dining areas.\\nUse of natural stone materials and wood for interior touchpoints in the lobby creates a timeless design aesthetic that continues throughout the building. The wood complements the wooden micro slats that filter sunlight through the energy-efficient facade.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nEven with the sophisticated medical equipment, clinical floors have a warm, welcoming feeling. Natural light and views to the outside help patients intuitively understand where they are and how to move through the space.\\xa0\\nLocating the infusion and radiation oncology services on the light-filled 4th floor instead of below grade, as in many hospitals, helps transform the patient experience. Instead of descending to a basement treatment area, the patient ascends onto a floor with access to daylight and city views.

Large cantilevered bay windows and tall glass atria reduce the building’s impact at street level and maintain natural light in workspaces and public areas. To reduce its visible mass, one-third of the structure is below ground, while the curved roof presents a gentle face to the community.\\nBreaking with traditional governance and tenure structures, the Crick represents a major paradigm shift for biomedical research in the global scientific community. Its researchers are free to follow their own instincts and direction, with no departments or tenure. Almost no idea is off limits, and there is only limited intellectual property. Discoveries are shared openly with the rest of the world.\\xa0\\nTo promote this innovative approach, the design creates easily adaptable and multidisciplinary research environments. The building can flex to meet its inhabitants’ continuously changing needs.\\nThe concepts of visibility and collaboration are central to the design. The building is composed of four blocks separated by a main east-west atrium and the smaller north-south transverse atrium. The main atrium’s cathedral-like scale is interrupted by the transverse atria where, on each level, one-third of the floor area is left open to create a double-height relationship with the adjacent floorplate and provide strong visual connections between floors. The junction of the two atria is dedicated to informal collaboration, breakout and administrative support spaces—all connected by a continuous open stair.\\nThe linear arrangement of lab neighborhoods optimizes visual permeability, offering views across the atrium into the write-up areas and through the primary labs.

Controlled access to vegetation\\xa0on terraces provides a therapeutic environment for healing. Oriented to reduce solar gain and capture prevailing breezes, the unique floor arrangement allows for double the amount of natural ventilation.\\xa0The project also includes solar thermal hot water heating and a large photovoltaic array.\\xa0It has been rated Platinum under Singapore’s\\xa0Green Mark\\xa0program.\\nThe team used detailed computational fluid dynamics models, shading analysis, climate analysis, daylight modeling and energy modeling to develop the design to optimize energy efficiency and the patient experience.\\xa0\\nAs design and medical planning consultant, HOK collaborated with the Singapore Ministry of Health and a team that included CPG Corporation (prime architect and architect of record) and Studio 505 (design collaborator focusing on building envelope development).\\nThe AIA COTE\\xa0\\nselected the project\\n\\xa0as one of the best examples of sustainable design excellence for 2017.\\xa0'], ['Central Bank of Kuwait Headquarters', 'Kuwait City, Kuwait', 'https://www.hok.com/design/service/architecture/central-bank-of-kuwait/', 'SIZE: 914,960 sq. ft. / 85,000 sq. m.\\n40 stories\\n\\nSERVICES: Architecture\\nMaster Planning\\n\\nAWARDS: Council on Tall Buildings & Urban Habitat (CTBUH), Award of Excellence Winner - Best Tall Building 200-299m + Interior Space Award\\nMEED Quality Awards for Projects - Best Building Project of the Year', 'The Central Bank of Kuwait’s new headquarters building is a symbol of the country’s significant economic power in the 21st century. \\nLocated in the Sharq commercial and financial district, it is a new landmark on Kuwait City’s skyline. The design creates a modern, comfortable work environment for bank staff.\\nThe office building is formed by a triangular, truncated pyramid tower intersected by a podium that houses reception and banking halls, conference facilities, dining and banquet rooms, and a museum.\\nThe geometric forms echo the geometry and order of Kuwaiti architecture. The two walls facing the sun are predominantly stone, while the northern elevation is glass. Viewed from the city, the stone facades block the intense desert sun and reflect the solidity and permanence of the Central Bank. Horizontal slots with recessed window openings minimize solar gain. At night, the all-glass viewing platform at the top of the building glows like a lighthouse.\\xa0In contrast to the stone facades, the transparent north elevation looks out across the Gulf, expressing Kuwait’s historic openness to commerce and trade\\n.\\n Panoramic views of the Gulf provide a constant reminder of the sea’s important role in the region.\\nVisitors enter the building through an expansive lobby. The wall opposite the reception desk and adjacent to the escalators features full-height, backlit, onyx pleated panels.\\nA retail bank branch on the ground floor provides banking services to staff and the community. On the second level, a 240-400-seat conference facility accommodates corporate events and can be subdivided for smaller gatherings.
