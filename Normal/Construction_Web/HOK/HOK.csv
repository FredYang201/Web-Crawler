Sustainable Design","LaGuardia Airport’s new Terminal B will provide a state-of-the-art passenger terminal and modern New York travel experience. 
The 35-gate terminal will replace the existing 1964 Central Terminal Building and optimize use of the airport’s limited airside and landside real estate.
Designed to transform LaGuardia Airport into a single, unified hub, the new facility will feature expanded transportation access and best-in-class passenger amenities. A phased construction approach allows it to be built on the constrained site with minimal impact to existing operations.
To optimize airfield performance and efficiencies, the team devised an island-concourse gate configuration. A pair of pedestrian bridges connects the headhouse to the island concourses. These iconic bridges traverse over active taxilanes and offer sweeping views of the airfield and Manhattan skyline.
The interior will feature intuitive wayfinding, ensuring the efficient movement of passengers through the terminal. Other enhancements will include an abundance of natural light at all levels, short curb-to-gate walking distances and regional cuisine and concession offerings.
The eastern concourse of the new Terminal B opened on Dec. 1, 2018. Featuring local and New York-themed restaurants and retail shops, family-friendly spaces and an indoor park, the new concourse has soaring, 55-foot-high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows that allow ample natural light to fill the space. Charging stations are placed throughout the gate seating areas with free, high-speed Wi-Fi. Family amenities include an airport-themed children’s play area.
By moving the terminal closer to Grand Central Parkway, the project will expand the airport taxiways by more than two miles and help reduce airport ground delays.
The project is expected to achieve LEED Silver certification for sustainable design and will open in phases. 
Under a 35-year lease agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, LaGuardia Gateway Partners (LGP) will design, build, manage and maintain LaGuardia’s Terminal B. LGP includes Vantage Airport Group, Skanska ID, Meridiam and JLC Infrastructure for development and equity investment; Skanska-Walsh as the design-build joint venture; HOK and WSP for architecture and engineering; and Vantage Airport Group for airport operations and management.
HOK is also providing master planning advisory services for LaGuardia in collaboration with the Port Authority and Delta Air Lines, which operates Terminal C and D on the airport’s east end."

Located on one of Abu Dhabi’s most prominent urban sites, the tower will create a new city landmark while articulating ADNOC’s role as one of the world’s most dynamic, influential petroleum companies. The proximity of the Emirates Palace Hotel adds to the site’s exclusivity, with the tower serving as the primary view for VIPs and patrons at the Emirates Palace complex.
The structure’s design maximizes views of the Arabian Gulf and takes advantage of the site’s prime location through careful massing of the tower and placement of the surrounding courts, plazas and landscape.
HOK’s design combines majestic spaces and high-quality materials. To maximize flexibility, offices are organized with a modular approach that is interchangeable and repeatable.
The tower’s north-south orientation minimizes the ground-level footprint, leaving ample room for landscaped amenity space. A rectilinear podium extends from the base of the tower. A curvilinear auditorium adjacent to the tower acts as a contrasting sculptural element.
Extending south of the tower structure, the three-level rectangular podium houses employee service retail space, the service loading area, a heritage museum, and the main lobby and circulation space.

AWARDS: World Stadium Congress - Stadium of the Year
The Stadium Business Awards - Venue of the Year
American Institute of Architects Central States - Large Commercial Category, Merit Award
National Council of Structural Engineers Associations - Excellence in Structural Engineering Awards - Halo Board at Mercedes-Benz Stadium","The client challenged HOK’s team to innovate on every level for the design of this new 71,000-seat stadium for the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons and the MLS’s Atlanta United FC.
The design establishes a new architectural icon for Atlanta and a new benchmark for sports venues while creating a fan experience that is second to none. Wallpaper named it one of the 
top buildings that shaped the world’s culture
 in 2017. 
Conventional retractable roofs feature utilitarian, sliding panels. For the design of Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the team found inspiration in the way sunlight passes through the oculus in the roof of the Pantheon in Rome. Made up of eight triangular ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) “petals” that move together along 16 individual tracks, the semi-transparent roof opens and closes like the aperture of a camera.
As a continuation of the roof, the ETFE facade features angular, wing-like exterior sections. The transparency creates a 16-story “window to the city” that draws in daylight and offers panoramic views of Atlanta’s skyline.
Wrapping the perimeter of the oval-shaped roof is a high-definition, 360-degree halo video board that gives fans an immersive, theater-in-the round experience. The one-of-a-kind video board is the largest in any of the world’s stadiums (nearly six stories high and 1,075-feet around) and provides clear views from every seat while preserving the beauty of the roof. An additional video display—a 100-foot-high mega column—is wrapped with a 3-D video board, and there are 2,000 TVs throughout the venue. More than 4,000 miles of integrated fiber-optic cable supports the technology-driven, interactive game-day experience inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium
A wide variety of seating options provide fans with different ticket prices, vantage points and levels of service. Amenities include a technology lounge and the 100 Yard Club, a row of concession stands that is bookended by bars and that stretches as long as the field itself.
The stadium can be easily reconfigured to accommodate games for the Falcons, Atlanta United and world-class events including the Super Bowl, NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Four and major concerts. Retractable seats surrounding the field and a motorized curtain system help soccer fans get close to the action. An entirely digital stadium platform creates opportunities to display custom content for each event.
Designed for sustainability, Mercedes-Benz Stadium is North America’s first 
LEED Platinum professional sports stadium
. A 600,000-square-foot cistern helps recapture and reuse rainwater. This helps protect the neighborhood from flooding and provides rainwater to irrigate trees throughout the city. The site has more than 4,000 solar PV panels. The focus on sustainability extends into the community through connections to public transit and the creation of urban farming areas and open recreation spaces.
In addition to serving as an anchor for the downtown tourist and entertainment district, the stadium will catalyze changes in surrounding neighborhoods. District-scale thinking enables the building to share resources with nearby developments.
HOK collaborated on the design with tvsdesign, Goode Van Slyke Architecture and Stanley Beaman & Sears. HOK’s structural engineers collaborated with BuroHappold, with WSP providing MEP and fire protection engineering."

The 20-building complex serves as the world research headquarters for the global consumer electronics brand of LG Group and a hub for science and technology in South Korea. Expected to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the campus will eventually accommodate up to 25,000 people.
HOK’s design mirrors LG’s aspirations to create “advanced technology, beautifully designed.” Individual buildings exhibit the same elegance as the company’s consumer products, which feature streamlined, elegant exteriors wrapped around cutting-edge technology.
Emphasizing LG’s minimalist approach to form, the post-and-beam, frame-based construction establishes a timeless design. Transparent ground-level spaces seamlessly connect the buildings to a new east-west linear park with plazas and gardens open to LG’s employees and the community so they appear to grow out of the landscape. This is especially evident at the lower level canteen and dining halls, which captivate guests with their access to natural light and garden views.
Though the campus is unified, every component is distinct. Each LG business group has its own main entrance and lobby. Natural stone frames the building elevations, which are in-filled with glass panels. This creates a variety of façade treatments that minimize heat gain and facilitate views to neighboring parks.
Building materials, which are as classic and durable as LG’s consumer products, include glazing, natural stone cladding and aluminum mullions. The pale natural stone facades of the research buildings contrast with the dark-clad Integrated Support Centre (ISC), which is located at the heart of the campus and houses a welcome center and employee amenities."
NewYork-Presbyterian David H. Koch Center ,"New York, New York, USA",https://www.hok.com/design/service/architecture/newyork-presbyterian-david-h-koch-center-/,AWARDS: ENR New York - Best Healthcare Project,"The team designed NewYork-Presbyterian’s new ambulatory care center in Manhattan to provide exceptional patient care now and into the future.
The first filter for each design decision was how it would minimize stress and improve the patient experience. The building also needed to be flexible to adapt to future changes in technology and patient care. 
Home to a wide range of ambulatory care services, the facility includes outpatient surgery, endoscopy, interventional radiology, diagnostic imaging, radiation oncology, infusion and digestive disease treatments. 
With its glass-encapsulated wood screen facade and transparent lower floors, the building presents a warm, hospitable face to the community. At the street-level entrance, canopies and a private drive-through welcome guests.            
A 40-foot-high, daylit main lobby offers patients and their families respite from the congested city. The light-filled interiors continue up through each floor’s sky lobbies and primary circulation areas. Within the main lobby, a dramatic staircase invites guests up to a second-story, living room-like space with quiet zones, lounges and dining areas.
Use of natural stone materials and wood for interior touchpoints in the lobby creates a timeless design aesthetic that continues throughout the building. The wood complements the wooden micro slats that filter sunlight through the energy-efficient facade.      
Even with the sophisticated medical equipment, clinical floors have a warm, welcoming feeling. Natural light and views to the outside help patients intuitively understand where they are and how to move through the space. 
Locating the infusion and radiation oncology services on the light-filled 4th floor instead of below grade, as in many hospitals, helps transform the patient experience. Instead of descending to a basement treatment area, the patient ascends onto a floor with access to daylight and city views. Designed with a hospitality feeling, private rooms and community spaces help patients feel comfortable.   
To help the hospital adapt the building to its future needs, the design incorporates a long-span structural system and tall floor-to-floor heights. Columns are placed to provide the most open, flexible space. Each clinical procedure floor has a standard layout and rooms. Removable exterior panels on the facade will enable NewYork-Presbyterian to move new medical equipment into the building as it becomes available. 
The team designed the building for a minimum of LEED Silver certification. Sustainable strategies include a green roof, high-performance building skin and high-efficiency mechanical systems. The distinctive exterior facade, which consists of triple-paned insulated glazing with an encapsulated wood screen, significantly reduces solar glare, heat gain and the need for solar or privacy shading. The resilient design enables the building to continue operating during an extreme weather event or disruption to the city power. 
The collaborative design team included HOK as architect and interior designer (public spaces), Ballinger as medical architect and interior designer (clinical spaces), and Pei Cobb Freed & Partners as consulting architect for the building envelope and lobby.

and Silver Jubilee Cu","Six visionary medical research and educational organizations partnered to form the Francis Crick Institute, Europe’s largest and most ambitious biomedical research facility.
The partnership includes the Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Trust, University College London, Imperial College London and King’s College London.
Located in central London, the steel, glass and terra-cotta clad building occupies a full city block and creates strong architectural links to historic local buildings. Large cantilevered bay windows and tall glass atria reduce the building’s impact at street level and maintain natural light in workspaces and public areas. To reduce its visible mass, one-third of the structure is below ground, while the curved roof presents a gentle face to the community.
Breaking with traditional governance and tenure structures, the Crick represents a major paradigm shift for biomedical research in the global scientific community. Its researchers are free to follow their own instincts and direction, with no departments or tenure. Almost no idea is off limits, and there is only limited intellectual property. Discoveries are shared openly with the rest of the world. 
To promote this innovative approach, the design creates easily adaptable and multidisciplinary research environments. The building can flex to meet its inhabitants’ continuously changing needs.
The concepts of visibility and collaboration are central to the design. The building is composed of four blocks separated by a main east-west atrium and the smaller north-south transverse atrium. The main atrium’s cathedral-like scale is interrupted by the transverse atria where, on each level, one-third of the floor area is left open to create a double-height relationship with the adjacent floorplate and provide strong visual connections between floors. The junction of the two atria is dedicated to informal collaboration, breakout and administrative support spaces—all connected by a continuous open stair.
The linear arrangement of lab neighborhoods optimizes visual permeability, offering views across the atrium into the write-up areas and through the primary labs. These lab neighborhoods can support rapid reconfiguration as research programs change. A centralized service distribution system enables a kit-of-parts approach in which predetermined components can be plugged into service spines in different combinations.
The scope and range of the Crick’s core facilities, which house services and technologies used by the entire research community, are unique. The proportion of shared core areas to primary and secondary lab facilities is nearly 50 percent—significantly higher than what is found at most research facilities.
The building site is in the heart of central London’s existing scientific community, where it anchors a local hub of research facilities. These proximities fuel collaboration and innovation.
Among the technical challenges was designing for sensitive lab equipment on an urban site. Special design measures provide equipment bases that achieve near-zero vibration criteria.
The building was certified BREEAM Excellent for environmental sustainability.
HOK served as architect and ‎lead designer responsible for the project’s overall design concept, interior design, lab planning and landscape architecture. PLP collaborated with HOK in shaping the building’s distinctive form and striking architectural expression.

Located on BP’s campus in the Houston Energy Corridor, the Center for High-Performance Computing houses one of the world’s largest supercomputers for commercial research. HOK’s team collaborated with BP’s top geologists and scientists to ensure that the high-performance workplace supports its world-class data center.
The building’s low-rise profile stands out among the campus high-rises. Its fully glazed, undulating north facade captures attention while welcoming visitors with an approachable scale. To develop the exterior, the team abstracted and pixelated images of geophysical strata produced by the computers inside. These images were translated into the ripples of the glass facade and the patterns on the concrete panels. 
Servers and mechanical systems are oriented to the south of the site and encased in the opaque, pre-cast concrete shell while the fully glazed office spaces are located to the north. The design layers and stacks the building’s functions, with the materiality communicating the programs of the internal spaces. 
Optimal solar orientation and high-performance mechanical and electrical systems provide a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.35, which is well below the typical data center average of 1.85. 
The resilient design strategies respond to BP’s need for the center to continue operating during manmade or natural disasters. Designed to resist winds of up 130 mph, the facade is the first line of defense. The second layer of protection is inside, where reinforced CMU walls define the data center and protect the computers. The high-performance computing spaces are equipped with a steeper roof slope than the rest of the building, ensuring that water drains away from the equipment. In the case of a water outage, an underground reservoir can assist with cooling the space and equipment for up to 16 hours. "

When it opens, the PIF Tower will position Riyadh as the financial and economic center of the Middle East. It is the centerpiece and tallest structure within the King Abdullah Financial District, a mixed-use development that creates a world-class financial hub for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
Together with its integrated facade system, the iconic geometry of the building contributes to a highly functional yet strikingly original form on Riyadh’s skyline. The tower’s crystalline facade references the crystals found in wadis—dry ravines located in the Saudi Arabian desert. This transparency creates an open grid and provides access to natural light within the office tower.
A high-performance enclosure incorporates solar shading, photovoltaic solar collection, facade lighting and an innovative facade access system. This integrated solution reinforces the overall building design and geometry while minimizing solar gain and internal cooling loads and reducing HVAC requirements. Energy is reclaimed through a photovoltaic array installation on the tower’s roof.
The modular plan creates a highly efficient interior environment with clear-span floor plates that maintain flexibility and adaptability across every level of the structure. Combining public circulation and private amenity space, the podium structure at the base includes an auditorium, cafeteria and two-story atrium.
An innovative vertical transportation system integrates one of the world’s largest installations of the TWIN® elevator system with double-deck shuttles. Two elevator cabs travel independently—one above the other—in the same shaft.

HOK is designing the UPMC Vision and Rehabilitation Hospital for patients in the Pittsburgh region and beyond who need physical rehabilitation and those who have diseases of the eye or vision impairment.
As a new Pittsburgh landmark on a prominent site along the Boulevard of the Allies, this state-of-the-art facility will position UPMC at the global forefront of rehabilitation and ophthalmic research and care. Clinicians, researchers, educators and industry partners will come together here to accelerate the process of translating research into innovative treatments for patients.
Physical cues will help patients and visitors navigate from their point of entry throughout the hospital. Strategies include providing proper lighting levels related to contrast and brightness, specifying materials and textures that aid people with canes, and using sound as a wayfinding tool. Chris Downey, AIA, one of the world’s few blind architects, is advising the team on how to design the space to best support the visually impaired.
The materials used for the building facade—an energy-efficient patterned glass, warm terra-cotta and brick—respect the architecture of Mercy’s campus and the neighborhood. The landscape acts as an extension of the existing hospital. Visitors are greeted by clear views into the building, signaling that this is a destination for healing, an incubator for medical advancements and a hub for biomedical research.
The building will include an innovative, low-vision, clinic-gym hybrid that anchors the program with an interactive healing center, exam rooms, therapy stations and a central gym. There is a fully mocked-up apartment and street lab where patients can go through simulations that teach them critical life skills.

AWARDS: Sports Business Awards - Sports Facility of the Year","When they are in use, arenas and stadiums are the most electric spaces in a city.
Yet even the most active of these facilities often lie dormant for days at a time between games and other events. Little Caesars Arena, home to the NHL’s Detroit Red Wings and NBA’s Detroit Pistons, solves this “all-or-nothing” paradox with a deconstructed design that engages the community 365 days a year.
Inside-out approach to space:
 Key to the design is the “Via,” the arena’s innovative central concourse enclosed by a translucent tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) roof structure. During the day, the Via serves as a light-filled, temperature-controlled public space shared by restaurants and shops that open to both the street and the arena’s interior. At night, light and energy generated from activity inside the Via project outward onto the community, drawing new visitors to the space.
Connecting to a revitalized Detroit:
 Little Caesars Arena anchors The District Detroit, a 50-block area of commercial, entertainment and residential buildings that connect downtown and midtown into one contiguous, walkable area. The arena’s design contributes to the density and energy of the district with restaurants, shops and commercial workspaces (including Google’s Detroit offices) housed within its brick-and-glass perimeter spaces. An outdoor events plaza flanked by a large LED video board provides additional use beyond the arena’s walls.
Heightened energy, intimate views:
 The steep, below-grade seating bowl embraces the iconic qualities of historic arenas, with improved sight lines and dense “walls” of people energizing the event and giving fans the best views. An array of diverse premium seating offerings, including gondola suites suspended from the roof, complement this intimacy."

CG/LA Infrastructure - Strategic Project of the Year","The design of the passenger terminal complex at Qatar’s new airport celebrates form, surface and light while providing a highly efficient yet inspirational experience for travelers.
As the landmark home for Qatar Airways, the country’s national airline, the terminal has 41 unrestricted contact gates.
Through expressive architecture rooted in place, the iconic terminal creates a lasting impression on guests. While contemporary in design to mirror Qatar’s progressive growth, the airport pays homage to the nation’s rich cultural heritage and natural environment. The dramatic, curving building silhouette recalls ocean waves and sand dunes to project a powerful image as Qatar’s gateway to the world.
Departing passengers experience an undulating super roof in the light-filled departure hall. The steel-framed glass wall provides unobstructed views from the curbside arrival area through the ticketing hall, enabling passengers to easily find their destinations. The longer east and west facades have similar high-performance glass that controls solar heat gain and glare. Moving through an open immigration area, originating passengers join transfer passengers on the first floor under a vast central skylight that provides visual access to one of five concourses. The two large transfer hubs are linked by an automatic people mover.
Arriving passengers progress to the ground-floor baggage hall and exit to a triple-volume meeters and greeters hall with direct access to taxi pavilions and an intermodal transportation hub.
A vast wood ceiling in the longest concourse provides visual warmth that contrasts with the sleek metal and glass surfaces. In other concourses, vaulted metal ceilings mimic the undulating roof line. Glass envelops the spacious hold rooms, quiet rooms, passenger activity nodes and 17 airline lounges. Skylights and interconnecting glass ceiling “zippers” provide natural light and dramatic evening desert views.
A deliberate lack of ornamentation provides passengers with an intrinsic understanding of movement and spatial function within the terminal. The team selected materials for their longevity, sustainability and local significance. Graceful structural arches are left unadorned, and the vast floor surface is a combination of terrazzo in high-circulation areas and carpet in ancillary spaces.
South of the passenger terminal, a public mosque serves as the symbolic heart of the airport. Its domed prayer hall and slender minaret are visible from the entrance road. The structures are set within a stone-paved plaza dotted with fountain jets representing the purifying role of water.
Guest amenities include two hotels, ample duty free shopping, and a spa and health club. An extensive public art program features local and international artists’ work throughout the terminal."

Sustainable Design","This new campus for the International School of Kuala Lumpur (ISKL)’s K-12 students is an urban oasis on a dense, 25-acre site in the heart of Malaysia’s bustling capital city.
The design vision was to create a sustainable learning environment for ISKL’s 1,600 students. From the clean air the students breathe to the natural light that illuminates their classrooms and the shaded outdoor spaces that connect them to nature, this new campus blends the indoors and outdoors to embody sustainable living.
Working closely with ISKL’s faculty, students and parents, HOK’s team designed a campus that unifies a kindergarten, an elementary school, a middle school and a high school. With its design firmly rooted in its Malaysian context and climate, the campus takes its place among those of the world’s best international schools.
A curved connecting spine aligned north-south links the different teaching blocks and forms a threshold between the school’s secure private world and the city’s outer public realm. Public elements are at the center of the campus, with the auditorium, recital hall, gallery, studio theatre and elementary school theatre all grouped around a central open plaza. This is the heart of the school—a place where ISKL can come together as one and also reach out to the broader Kuala Lumpur community.
The building blocks of the schools are the classroom clusters, which are designed around shared principles but applied to suit the needs of different age groups. Classrooms large enough to accommodate a variety of teaching methods are organized around a central commons.
As Malaysia’s first school to achieve the World Wildlife Funds Eco-Schools Green Flag award, environmental education was already embedded into its curriculum. ISKL is also the first school to register and achieve Malaysia’s Green Building Index Platinum rating for sustainable design.
Passive solar design strategies drove the form and layout of the building, which is projected to use 60 percent less energy than the average school in similar hot, humid climates. Arranging the teaching blocks in an east-west alignment draws in daylight while protecting classrooms from the intense sun at the beginning and end of the day. Light shelves on the classrooms’ north and south edges drive daylight deep into the space and reduce artificial lighting loads.
The design borrows from two aspects of traditional Malaysian architecture to improve thermal comfort: screens and shelter. Existing mature plantings and a screened facade shield the eastern elevation, with major openings limited to the northern and southern ends. An open undercroft beneath the middle and high schools creates sheltered spaces for socializing and dining. Naturally ventilated, covered walkways lead to the center of each teaching wing. 
Visible sub meters that are part of the building management system act as a teaching tool that reveals the school’s real-time resource consumption and encourages students to look for ways to save energy.

A series of outdoor courtyards provide a formal progression toward the mosque, located in the middle of the site’s central green space. The courtyards have an axial alignment toward Mecca and the Kaaba.
Surrounded by a reflective pool, the mosque is elevated three feet above the adjacent outdoor spaces. This pool glows at night, creating the illusion that the building is levitating over water. Worshipers enter the mosque by climbing floating stone steps and traversing a glass bridge over the reflective pool.
As a monolithic core perforated with a pattern of glowing windows and surrounded by glass, the mosque’s appearance changes from day to night. During the day, the shadows from the complex mullion patterns travel over the inner stone facade, creating a dynamic experience that varies by season. At night, the glass box acts like a lantern washed with light at the bottom and punctuated with points of light near the top.
The interior is an interplay of shade and shadows, viewed through the lens and technological interpretation of a traditional mashrabiya screen wall. Wrapping all four walls and the ceiling, the screen glows with the natural light of the punched windows and skylights, creating a bright, modern interior. Layers of scale overlap on the mashrabiya walls, while the ceiling has a pure, traditional pattern.
Located adjacent to the mosque, the 115-foot-tall minaret tower mirrors the patterns of the mosque’s facade and facilitates the daily calls to prayer."

Structural Engineering","The world’s most traveled airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, is embarking on a $6 billion, 20-year expansion and modernization program.
As part of the capital improvement program, HOK is leading the joint venture team designing a $200 million improvement to the airport’s domestic passenger terminal. The project features the addition of two large canopies over curbside pick-up and drop-off areas and a redesigned central atrium space.
In 2015, the 207-gate Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport became the world’s first airport to handle more than 100 million passengers in a year, reaching a high of 101.5 million. As the airport prepares to serve even more travelers in the coming decades, the design of the terminal modernization will improve the passenger experience.
The airport’s vision is to create an exceptional experience for all its guests. The solution embraces the buzz of the world’s most traveled airport while giving passengers a sense of ease and clarity navigating the world-class, 400,000-sq.-ft. domestic terminal.
Visitors will arrive and depart under two transparent new canopies providing shelter and comfort from Atlanta’s ever-changing weather while maintaining access to views of the sky and daylight. Composed of translucent ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) panels supported by a contemporary steel frame, the 864-foot-long canopies help redefine the character of the building as a 21st-century air terminal.
Central to the passenger experience, the design of a 15,000-sq.-ft. atrium creates a lush, park-like setting that reflects the Atlanta landscape and is brightened by a circular skylight. In this space, passengers can pause and relax on their way to and from gates. Integrated technology connects passengers to retail and information in the context of a microcosm of Atlanta’s culture. The design converts the atrium from a processing space to an engaging civic area that connects visitors and travelers to Atlanta, reinforcing the airport as an ambassador for the region.
The high-performance design features energy-efficient cladding and building systems. Ceilings will be altered to improve the harvesting of natural light and to optimize interior lighting systems, which include LED lighting.
Improved circulation and signage systems will make wayfinding intuitive. A clearly marked airport security screening zone leads passengers from the atrium to concourses and gates. Improvements to the baggage claim area include highly visible digital monitors and new speaker systems.
The HOK-led joint venture for the terminal modernization includes Stanley, Love-Stanley, P.C., and Chasm Architecture, L.L.C., both headquartered in Atlanta."

The design harnesses the energy of this rapidly transforming landscape. 
Siting the hotel adjacent to 
Porsche’s Experience Center
 enhances the interaction of the two buildings’ complementary forms. The hotel’s horizontal stance, articulated roof and simple color palette of pearl white and charcoal gray evoke a modern sense of understated power and movement.
The design of the hotel’s signature form optimizes the building’s performance and energy use while connecting the guest experience with Porsche’s high-performance automobiles and the roaring engines of planes overhead. Each room enjoys a view of planes, trains, automobiles or the downtown skyline.
With its efficient use of space and focus on luxury, the hotel takes planning and stylistic cues from modern European properties. It is sophisticated without being formal, worldly without being pretentious and luxurious while still comfortable. Subtle motorsport-related interior design elements speak to the essence of Porsche’s global brand.
Guest amenities include a signature fine-dining restaurant, business meeting facilities with flexible ballrooms, 18 executive suites, a health club, a spa and pool, and a rooftop lounge with sweeping views to Porsche’s 1.6-mile driving experience track and the world’s busiest airport.
Despite the proximity to Porsche’s track, the airport and active railroad tracks, guests can retreat to the quiet comfort of their rooms or enjoy relaxing conversations over a meal. The team mitigated the site’s noise by specifying continuous insulation over enhanced exterior wall assemblies, concrete masses at roof decks and triple-glazed curtain wall systems with a six-inch air space. 
The hotel, which reclaims the brownfield site of an abandoned Ford automobile manufacturing plant, is another catalyst for development in Atlanta’s growing Aerotropolis district."

Inspired by the region’s natural beauty, the center’s two towers anchor a retail mall and offer panoramic views of the Gan River and Nanchang’s cityscape. The river location helps attract residents and tourists.
One tower exclusively houses offices. The other includes a five-star hotel on the top floors and offices in lower levels. The retail mall’s canopy, meanwhile, offers a unique indoor/outdoor experience that features international brands and dining facilities.
In designing the towers, HOK’s team found inspiration in the sculptural form of the ceramic vases produced in the Jiangxi region. Tapering at the top and bottom, the towers’ smooth, undulating facade creates a distinct appearance that, like the river, appears to change shape when viewed from different angles. The triangular plan maximizes views to the river while creating a structurally sound building form.
Retail space along the river is stepped and terraced to maximize space and act as a natural extension of the river’s edge. The terraces feature inviting architectural details and provide exclusive views of the waterfront and greenbelt while offering ample space for al fresco dining. On the west, a low-scale outdoor retail streetscape is set against the larger indoor mall, providing visitors a diverse shopping experience.

Terminal Planning","Will Rogers World Airport is serving more passengers, flights and destinations every year. As Oklahoma City’s leaders embarked on an ambitious program to design an expansion to the terminal, they also saw the opportunity to design a better passenger experience.
The team designed the expansion to enhance people’s satisfaction at each step of their journey through the airport. Passengers who have a positive experience in terminals are more likely to return and, feeling more relaxed, will spend more money in airport shops and restaurants.
The design accomplishes this in several ways:
Streamlining security screenings
: The project includes a new eight-lane security checkpoint that will replace the two existing checkpoints and relieve congestion. Minimizing the number of columns here creates highly flexible, open space that makes it easier for passengers to move through security while also supporting future changes to TSA’s screening programs.
New town square
: Beyond the security checkpoint, travelers enter a “town square” that acts as the new heart of the airport. From here they have access to a variety of shopping, dining and lounge spaces conveniently located just steps from their gates. A dramatic skylight and expansive windows draw in natural light and create a bright, relaxed indoor environment. Public art installations connect passengers to Oklahoma City and its residents.
Destination in itself
: To further engage the community, the project is bringing back a feature from the Golden Age of air travel: a public observation gallery. This suspended viewing deck floats in a pre-security area above the terminal’s town square. Open to visitors, the gallery will have aviation-related exhibits and offer memorable views of the concourses and airfield. From this space meeters and greeters can also see friends and family members move through the gates.
More flights
: Adding four gates enables Will Rogers World Airport to attract more airlines and offer travelers more flight options. This increases the total number of gates to 21 and begins to establish an east concourse that can be expanded in the future. The airport also is using this expansion project to prepare to offer direct international service from Oklahoma City in the future. Under the new concourse, the team designed a shell for an international arrivals facility that can quickly be configured to handle two simultaneous arriving wide-body aircraft.
Familiar but new
: The architectural design for the expansion respects the existing terminal while reinterpreting it in a contemporary way. In the new wing, for example, the design preserves the color palette of the original floor tile yet recreates it with much more durable terrazzo.
Other amenities
: High-tech improvements will enable passengers to receive real-time flight information on their smart phones. A wider concourse provides more space for different seating options and amenities.
Business as usual
: To minimize disruptions to the airport’s operations, the team was able to add temporary gates, isolate the area under construction and designate it as a landside access site. This designation made it more efficient and economical to build on compared to an airside site.
HOK has collaborated with Oklahoma City-based FSB on the design."

The New Palau Blaugrana, which will have a capacity of 12,000 for sporting events and 12,500 for social and cultural events, is a key component of a broader project to improve FC Barcelona’s facilities and create the Espai Barça sports district. The arena for 
FC Barcelona Lassa
, a Euroleague team, will replace the existing 7,500-seat Palau Blaugrana, which opened in 1971. When the New Palau Blaugrana is complete, in time for the 2019-2020 season, it will be a highly immersive destination integrated into a thriving sports and entertainment district.
The arena’s curvilinear form and organic geometry include an elegant, metallic facade with transparencies that strategically connect fans to the surroundings. This transparency creates an inviting atmosphere and provides glimpses of the action taking place inside. A large exterior projection screen on the underside of the arena’s roof will show footage of the event underway to fans in the public plaza.
To engage fans beyond the arena’s walls, the design blends the indoors and outdoors. An open-air concourse celebrates the Mediterranean climate and optimizes year-round revenue generation opportunities through concession areas and amenities that the public can enjoy 365 days a year. Outdoor patios, public plazas and green spaces across the site, which will be vehicle-free, create informal gathering places.
HOK and TAC Arquitectes designed the seating bowl to emulate a theater environment with an asymmetrical design—the first of its kind for a basketball arena—that provides more capacity on one side. Using state-of-the-art, customized digital tools, the designers calibrated the venue and bowl geometries to achieve optimal results for viewing quality, shape and dimensions of the event spaces. The compact building span reduces structural costs and improves operational efficiencies. In addition, the tighter, steeper and more intimate bowl provides exceptional sightlines, creates a “wall of people” and captures the noise to create an intense spectator environment and intimidating venue for visiting teams. A flexible, retractable seating configuration adapts for various uses and maintains the current Palau’s reputation as an energetic, intimidating arena that provides a unique experience for Euroleague fans.
The design prioritizes sustainability, reducing the energy and water demands by passive means while minimizing waste and incorporating local plants and materials. Water-saving fixtures, daylighting designed in response to the radiation map, low-emission materials, building automation and paperless ticketing enhance operational efficiencies.

HOK, in association with ATB and Dialog, was commissioned by the city of Edmonton and the NHL’s Edmonton Oilers to design a new arena and to oversee the master plan of an adjacent mixed-use district and plaza. The arena and district represent a significant reinvestment in the city fabric by the Oilers Entertainment Group.
One of the challenges was connecting the arena to the ICE District and Edmonton’s downtown. HOK and planners proposed extending the arena’s footprint over the main thoroughfare—104 Avenue—to connect the two parcels of land identified for development. This elevated, multipurpose entryway, dubbed the Winter Garden, is enhanced by street-level commercial development. The covered extension creates bold connectivity, a physical presence and a distinctive brand identity that reinforces the street grid and activates Rogers Place and the ICE District year-round.
The ICE District, envisioned in collaboration with Shugarman Architecture + Design, WAM Development and Hariri Pontarini Architects, will be a lively mixed-use development spanning 25 acres. The district includes a community rink, private development, office development, residential units and parking spaces, as well as a connection to an existing light-rail system.
The arena design creates a premium experience for every guest. Seating options include 3,100 club seats, 900 PCL Loge seats, 500 drink rail seats, 300 ozone club seats, 57 Scotiabank executive suites, 24 theater boxes, three clubs, two club lounges and Curve, a full-service restaurant. The arena features the NHL’s largest high-definition scoreboard, at 46-by-46 feet, as well as more than 1,200 HDTVs. 
As Canada’s first LEED Silver-certified NHL arena and the second in North America, the facility is designed to use 37 percent less water and 14 percent less energy than conventionally design venues.
Since opening in 2016, the arena has surpassed attendance expectations for sporting events, community events and concerts. The venue hosted numerous sell-outs for the Oilers and the largest-ever attendance for the Western Hockey League’s Edmonton Oil Kings.

The design encourages a learning culture that promotes curiosity, collaboration and excellence in medical education and practice. Through a thoughtful interplay of materials and developing technologies, the design creates a facility that pushes the boundaries of medical education.
Contrasting colors, shapes and forms enable the commons building to present a contemporary image from all directions. The building massing reflects the surrounding campus and internal program while providing a balanced range of human-scaled elements and spaces.
The three-story building features high-tech classrooms, teaching labs and a 40,000-sq.-ft. simulation center for Augusta University’s medical and dental schools. Most of the occupied spaces have generous amounts of glass, providing panoramic campus views and ample daylighting. Four large, open staircases connect all three floors.
Two 300-seat auditoriums have fully integrated audiovisual equipment and technology for distance learning. A tiered design enables team-based learning. Two 150-seat lecture halls function as large classrooms or flex to accommodate small group work. Thirteen small-group classrooms and 13 learning community spaces bring together a variety of students. The building also includes a covered outdoor patio, a café, two executive conference rooms and an administration suite.
The team designed the building for LEED Silver certification. The southern facade features a glass window wall with dramatic sunshades that protect the interior from solar exposure. To the east and west, the narrow facade reduces exposure to the rising and setting sun. To the north, the wall system is predominately transparent glazing. Sustainable design strategies also include two energy recovery units, a highly reflective membrane roof, low-flow water fixtures, low-VOC materials, a stormwater detention system and proximity sensors for the lighting and HVAC systems."

AWARDS: European Healthcare Design Awards - Future Healthcare Design Award
World Architecture News - Future Projects Healthcare Award","The design of this private hospital, which will serve the healthcare needs of Shanghai’s rapidly growing affluent population, accommodates complex healthcare delivery 
models and emerging technologies.
The design made allowances for current and future challenges facing the regional healthcare system, most importantly the “silver tsunami”—the forecasted wave of a growing elderly population. 
HOK’s plan creates a clear separation of zones of activities, with departments and functions located based on access point proximity, flow and wayfinding. The outpatient lobby, core and outpatient functions are adjacent to the primary outpatient entry to the south. Similarly, inpatient functions are located near inpatient cores and are accessible from the main entry to the east. The contiguous arrangement of the clinics provides optimum flexibility to house specialty centers, individual medical suites or a combination.
The design team used biophilic strategies and regenerative principles to improve patient health outcomes while conserving energy. The building’s position on the site and massing were informed by a rigorous solar analysis that optimizes access to daylight and wind. 
The gentle curves of the building massing circumvent sharp corners, allowing for the natural flow of space, air and light. HOK’s design combines advanced practices for lighting, daylighting, HVAC and water treatment systems that use significantly less energy while performing at or above current health standards, with a target of at least 50 percent energy reduction compared to similar facilities.
Textured natural materials and smooth finished surfaces form the exterior materials palette. The patient towers and central core are clad in glass and light-colored metal panels, while the building podium is enveloped by a hillside. In the central public atrium, warm limestone flooring, glass panels and wood screens help create a peaceful, healing environment.
All patient rooms and most staff spaces provide access to outside views, operable windows and landscaped terraces."

Terminal Planning","Thirty years after designing King Khalid International Airport (KKIA), HOK is the design team leader for the expansion of Terminals 
3 and 4.
This expansion will enable the airport to meet increasing demand and support the country’s growing economy. As with the original airport, the design creates a strong sense of place and a passenger-friendly terminal welcoming each traveler as an important guest to Riyadh.
When HOK designed the four terminal buildings in the 1980s, one was left as an empty building shell. The design brief for the current project was to integrate and extend Terminals 3 and 4 as an infill development that complements and enhances the existing airport while accommodating 17.5 million passengers per year. The project also introduces a central processor building and three new piers with 24 gates.
The integrated design solution responds to Riyadh’s culture while providing memorable spaces. The hexagonal roof form and triangular organization of the original buildings guided the design. By basing the plan on the original module size, the team designed a seamless intervention with no clear distinction between old and new.
Sustainable strategies include replacing the existing terminals’ external cladding with a high-performance facade system and upgrading infrastructure with two new energy centers.
An integrated BIM strategy allows the entire design team to rationalize and coordinate the process throughout construction. The facilities are being refurbished in two phases to allow the existing airport operations to function at capacity during construction."

The Turkish government’s goal for the landmark project is to establish Istanbul as a global center for finance. The IIFC will house the head offices of the country’s financial market governing bodies, state-owned and private banks, and related businesses. It will include 45 million square feet of office, residential, retail, conference, hotel and park space.
HOK’s master plan provides a framework for developing a sustainable financial center in a way that blends human need, environmental stewardship and economic viability into a new global model of urbanism rooted in Turkish culture.
The plan creates four distinct districts focusing on culture, commerce, civic functions and governance. Strategically located between the Ataşehir and 
Ü
mraniye districts, the site offers easy accessibility and views to the historic center of Istanbul.
Major infrastructure improvements include a transportation system featuring a new subway line and station as well as new infrastructure for sustainable power, water, data and security. These systems are integrated into a podium that provides a surface for a new urban park.
In addition to creating the master plan, architectural and landscape design standards, and sustainability guidelines, HOK is designing two of the IIFC’s high-rise office towers."

Structural Engineering","A new orphanage and children’s center in Port-au-Prince will create a culturally relevant model of sustainable construction that can be replicated throughout the region.
HOK is the USGBC’s official design partner for Project Haiti, the replacement of an orphanage and children’s center that was severely damaged in the 2010 earthquake. In a country with no enforceable codes or functioning infrastructure, this design puts forward a net zero energy, water and waste facility that meets LEED Platinum standards.
An all-volunteer HOK team, including architects, landscape architects, lighting designers, sustainable experts and structural, mechanical and plumbing engineers, is tackling the challenge of bringing highly sustainable design to a developing country. The goal is to design a nurturing, restorative place.
The design of the William Jefferson Clinton Children’s Center integrates biomimicry to create a locally attuned and responsive building solution. The building references a culturally significant keystone species, the kapok tree, both in the branching diagrid supports of the balcony system and the low emissivity, heat-shedding characteristics of its second skin. Protecting the building like tree bark, a bamboo “boundary layer” shields exterior walkways and vertical surfaces from direct sunlight while allowing for daylighting and natural ventilation. A roof garden acts as the building’s “foliage,” supporting the solar energy system and providing additional green space.
The net zero design uses passive and renewable strategies to support a safe, healthy environment for children, staff and future parents. The building systems are designed to provide independence from the city’s unreliable power grid, harnessing excess energy to power streetlights and public charging stations on the street.
To ensure a safe water supply, a closed-loop system collects, treats and stores water on-site. A water collection system on the roof funnels water into an underground cistern. Gray and black water are fed into a bioreactor, which filters and cleans it for reuse in landscaping.
To highlight Haiti’s rich artistic heritage, the design uses local materials and artwork, especially ironwork, murals and woodwork crafted by local artisans. Through this project, designers intend to educate local craftsmen on replicable, resilient construction techniques.
The main three-story, L-shaped structure envelops a central courtyard, the focal point of the orphanage’s social life. A separate tower contains training and office space. The kitchen and dining areas and corner stair tower provide refuge during hurricanes. In response to seismic risk, the design uses lightweight infill and contains a ground-level “safe zone” where occupants can gather in the event of an earthquake.
Project Haiti has been recognized as a Commitment Maker by the Clinton Global Initiative.

Transportation Security Administration - National Partnership Award","The Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal acts as a world-class gateway to Indianapolis while providing exceptional customer service and flexibility for future changes.
The building and its form represent Indianapolis’ vision for becoming a global crossroads. At the heart of the terminal, a 200-foot-wide room creates a great “Civic Plaza” where art, retail, social and civic functions converge and passengers can connect with the Indiana landscape. Capped with a hyperbolic glass and steel skylight, this room has become a threshold to the “crossroads of America.”
The desires to provide clarity for passengers and to achieve energy efficiency also give shape to the building. 
The hyperbolic roof reinforces the path of travel, defining both the great arched front as well as a passenger’s movement between landside and airside. In addition, the terminal roof is designed to shade the building’s curtain walls while providing scenic views of the Indiana landscape. The roof form, skylight and high-performance curtain wall systems were designed to work together to assure that primary building lighting is not in use during daylight hours throughout the departure level. These strategies are joined with a unique mechanical system of radiant floors and stratified ventilation that assure that only the building’s inhabited zone, below 10 feet, is tempered to human comfort.
“With views of the downtown skyline, the Indianapolis International Airport Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal has been celebrated for its sense of place, and for treating its passengers as guests, much the way the hotel industry does,” reported 
City Lab
. “It has its own civic plaza, a light-filled central space with 35-foot ceilings that functions as the nexus of activity—every passenger, whether arriving or departing, passes through—where half of all the airport’s shops and restaurants reside. Customers routinely comment on the terminal’s calm feel, and on its efficiency and easy navigation.”
This is the world’s first complete airport campus to earn LEED certification and one of the largest LEED-certified projects in the U.S

 award for innovative design that helps organizations achieve their business goals.
As the first phase of The Natural History Museum’s most significant development since it opened in 1881, the Darwin Centre offers visitors rare, behind-the-scenes access to the work and people of the museum. The building provides a new home for more than 22 million zoological specimens and laboratories for 100 scientists.
The team explored technical innovation within a design ethos of lasting civic architecture. The new building promotes research and exhibits its results in an atmosphere of dignified utility that has visual clarity, intellectual rigor and technical consistency.
The contemporary detailing recreates the historic tradition of “architecture parlante” – buildings whose external appearance describes what happens inside. The zoomorphic brackets of the solar wall, the changing appearance created by the sun-tracking metal louvers and the caterpillar-like inflated roof refer directly to the activities inside the building. The design team worked with English Heritage to ensure that the new building would complement nearby historical buildings.

em>Hotel Business magazine - New Construction Deal of the Year","The JW Marriott Indianapolis Downtown is the capstone of a multi-billion-dollar reinvention of the city.
As the largest JW Marriott in the world, this five-star, 34-story hotel houses 1,005 guest rooms and more than 100,000 square feet of meeting space. It serves the Indiana Convention Center, Lucas Oil Stadium and numerous downtown attractions.
HOK’s design strikes a delicate balance between the hotel’s proximity to natural resources and its urban setting. The glimmering, water-like facade reflects the movement of the sun, clouds and the city skyline.
An iconic, jewel-like glass tower rises above a podium to create a memorable new landmark that redefines the Indianapolis skyline. The crescent-shaped tower fronts the city and is pivoted within the site, reinforcing the downtown grid to the east while acknowledging the museum campus gardens and White River to the west and north.
A low-rise masonry and limestone podium wraps the west and south facades, contextually recognizing the adjacent museums and ballpark. The tower interlocks with the podium and presents itself in full height along the east and north facades adjacent to the central business district. A two-story, glass canopy and podium define the main entrance on West Street.
“A simple concept – a dramatic tower rising above the city-scaled plinth,” commented the jury in the AIA Indiana Design Awards. “The curve of the tower was just enough to create a bold presence on the skyline while the articulation of the curtain wall seemed to moderate the scale of the structure; the combination of the opaque podium mass and the glass tower create a building that simultaneously belongs to the earth and the sky; an articulated façade employs subtle, repetitive fins that change with the passing sun; this is a large and complicated program which is well executed both in plan and in massing.”"

AWARDS: Retail & Leisure International - Highly Commended","The design of Marina Mall supports Doha’s vision for a vibrant, community-oriented lifestyle for the Lusail waterfront development and its 19 mixed-use districts.
The design is inspired by the natural forms created when water and land meet. Five interconnected retail islands link the mall into the landscape and back to the water. A body of water running throughout the center of the scheme guides the visitor through the mall, leading to the marina. Internal waterfalls visually connect the different levels. The spaces between the five pebble-shaped islands are carefully landscaped, creating a series of green spaces.
The three-story mall includes cinemas, spa facilities and restaurants with terraced dining overlooking the marina. Smaller pods embedded in the landscape around the mall animate the threshold between the mall and the marina. These pods house additional retail space, exhibition spaces and entertainment areas.
Marina Mall’s complex, sculptural form was made possible by the team’s use of parametrics: scripting, digital simulation and modeling that enabled them to explore, generate and control complex architectural shapes. Combining parametric design techniques and building information modeling (BIM), the design team created a fully coordinated, complex architectural shape in a short timeframe. Using custom-optimized scripts offered efficiencies in speed and improved cost effectiveness, allowing the team to create an iconic design within strict cost and construction parameters.

The original aircraft hangars, designed in 1939 by Albert Kahn, inspired beautifully simple solutions for how the new center uses air, water and light. The team worked closely with local preservationists to keep the hangars close to their original condition.
The complex accommodates 715 people in a high-performance research and office campus that integrates NOAA’s mission of “science, service and stewardship” with the region’s cultural traditions and the island’s ecology. It houses a diverse range of critical programs, functions and federal departments, including the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.
Facilities include wet and dry research laboratories, a marine center, a library, administrative offices, conference and meeting areas, a dining hall and informal collaboration spaces.
The interior environment is based on the principles of campus design. Creating a central gathering place, the plan supports program-intensive workplaces with internal quadrangles of open space with primary and secondary circulation routes.
Connecting the front door of the campus with the waterfront, the three-story atrium knits together a sequence of materials and volumetric plane changes to give people a sense of progression as they move through the building. A series of interactive exhibits highlight the history of the island and region, as well as NOAA’s diverse mission.
Located at the northern end of the atrium, the dining hall provides users with a panoramic view to the water and the mountain range in the distance. The two-story fully glazed space maximizes transparency and creates a fluid visual experience. A 200-seat auditorium provides tiered seating for NOAA programs, while multiple conference rooms and flexible classrooms support collaborative activities.
The biological influences of the region guided the design of the LEED Gold project. A skylight diffuser system virtually eliminates the need for artificial light during the day. Hawaii’s first hydronic passive cooling unit (PCU) system uses chilled water from a nearby building and natural ventilation to condition the space through an underground air distribution system. A graywater capturing system is used to irrigate the native landscaping.

A series of canal-side walkways link the hotels, offices, shopping destinations and open spaces. A sweeping sky canopy features a 1,640-foot-long ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) canopy with an integrated LED screen.
The design creates urban landmarks, gateways and plazas to enhance the sense of place and subtly recreate the distinct character of the region’s traditional gardens.
Bridges and courtyards establish a rhythm of unique spaces that serve as backdrops and foregrounds for dining, strolling and shopping experiences along the canal.
Visitors access Times Square by water taxi, six subway entrances and 4,000 underground parking spaces. Pedestrian activity flows from the nearby convention center and administrative government offices and from surrounding residences and hotels.
As the cultural heart of Suzhou Industrial Park, the development is integrated with the Suzhou International Expo Center, the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Center, and the Suzhou Science and Arts Center. It is designed to serve the needs of the broader region and to support commercial and residential development around Jinji Lake."

Awards: Brick Development Association -﻿ Brick Awards, Best Commercial Building","The construction of a new office building with a retail ground floor in the heart of London’s historic Mayfair neighborhood reflects the area’s vibrant spirit.
Located in a Conservation Area among Georgian townhouses and imposing Victorian facades, the office building needed to balance contemporary and traditional aesthetics. Incorporating the essence of classical architecture, the design team worked with Grosvenor Estate and Stow Properties to give the building its own identity while ensuring that it fits comfortably in its surroundings.
Using building information modeling, the team maximized floor-to-ceiling heights while effectively inserting an entire floor in comparison to the Edwardian building it replaces.
The design reconciled a classically inspired elevation design, which typically would require decreased floor-to-floor heights moving up the building. By varying the size and detailing of the windows, an illusion of “piano nobile” exists along ground floor retail spaces. This helps integrate the building into its historic surroundings while maintaining the floor-to-floor heights of a modern office building on higher floors.
In reference to neighboring buildings, the exterior has the appearance of handset, handmade brickwork, with decorative elements crafted from Portland stone. The facade is actually composed of precast panels elegantly detailed to hide joints and junctions. Using this material accelerated construction while giving the facade a consistent appearance.
The quality of design, materials and detailing continues inside the building. The reception area, in particular, reflects the contemporary and exclusive luxury called for in the design brief.
The design team advised the clients on the selection of artists for the public artwork, which includes three solid bronze portcullis entrance gates designed by London artist Wendy Ramshaw, CBE.
BIM geometry and data developed throughout the design and construction process will aid in the building’s ongoing management. Key initiatives that will benefit the owners include asset tagging, online tools for building management systems, tenant fit-out guidelines and GIS models."

Forecasters across the U.S. rely on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ﻿and the National Weather Service to provide the fastest and most accurate information. ﻿Nearly all meteorological data collected globally arrives here for analysis by NOAA’s environmental scientists.
To support the organization’s mission of understanding and predicting changes in the earth’s environment, the design reduces the Center’s impact on the environment and physically embodies man’s relationship to nature. Just as natural systems do not operate in straight lines, the building is configured in a series of curving wings that intersect in a central atrium. The building form is organic, with “waves” of space.
The north elevation features continuous horizontal bands of windows that allow sweeping views into the woodland preserve. The south elevation consists of a curtain wall with sunscreens that reduce solar heat gain and act as light shelves that bounce daylight deep into interior spaces. Visible from the interior, the lower roof surfaces are vegetative planes. These surfaces surround the sweeping, inclined central roof that rises from the building entry to an apex at the cupola. Here, within the facility’s highest occupied space, researchers collect atmospheric data.
Designed as a central gathering space, the five-story atrium encourages the informal interaction between scientists and administrators that is crucial to the development of science. With the main stairs and amenities clustered around it, this atrium becomes the building’s social and emotional center.
Sustainable design strategies include water-sensitive site design, bioretention, energy performance optimization, natural daylighting, enhanced indoor air quality and increased thermal comfort and control.
A large, extensive green roof covers a majority of the roof surface, functioning as the building’s “fifth elevation.” Excess stormwater runoff from the roof moves down a waterfall by an outdoor dining terrace to a rain garden, where it collects and filters through wetland plantings. An underground cistern collects on-grade stormwater runoff to reuse for site irrigation.
The site’s planting palette features native and adapted species that can withstand challenging heat and drought conditions with little irrigation. The variety of native grasses, perennials, ferns and shrubs weave together in broad drifts beneath scattered trees, creating the feeling that the building has risen out of a natural landscape."

HOK’s team embraced the vision of the developers to transform an existing 20-acre business park into a futuristic tech office campus with open floor plans.
The relationships between buildings and open space are inspired by the dynamic relationship of converging biomes in the Santa Clara Valley. Each of the three four-story office buildings has an internal courtyard designed for year-round use with pedestrian pathways connecting all facilities and outdoor spaces.
Creating an oasis of urbanity in the suburbs, the campus is designed with a full complement of amenities. Shaped like a quarter circle, the amenities building features sweeping, full-story glass walls and upper-level clerestory windows that create the sensation of being on an open porch. A large, overhanging roof allows dining and gathering spaces to spill out onto an outdoor patio on the central quad.
The central quad includes an open plaza, detailed landscaping, public art, a sunken amphitheater, a large dining terrace, outdoor pavilions, and café chairs and tables.
Distinguishing the development in the crowded local office market, the campus has achieved LEED Platinum status and the buildings are designed to be net-zero energy ready. Instead of adding a separate solar shading system, the design extends the concrete floor slabs as protruding fins that act as built-in sunshades protecting the glass walls from direct solar heat gain and glare.
Conveniently located between the Lawrence and Sunnyvale Caltrain stations, auto courts and a designated shuttle depot provide pedestrian drop-off areas. Once they arrive, employees can navigate all areas of the campus internally without accessing city streets."

Its primary tenant is the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), one of three centers funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct basic research that generates technology to convert cellulosic biomass to ethanol and other biofuels.
This first phase includes five primary labs that focus on molecular biology, chemical engineering and organic chemistry research; a 1,400-sq.-ft. applied engineering high-bay laboratory for solar and biofuels projects; a central NMR; two videoconferencing rooms; and an education and public outreach suite including biofuel demonstration gardens. The flexible, “plug and play” wet and dry laboratories easily adapt to changes in research teams.
An interior light well supports each research floor. The light well provides open sightlines and highways for interaction between researchers and staff in the offices and work stations that ring the perimeter of the floor and the laboratories at its interior. Bridge walks spanning the light wells provide accessibility, while break rooms, seating nooks and formal meeting areas offer opportunities for collaboration.
Reflecting its clean energy research mission, the Institute is an energy-efficient research facility. The sustainable strategies include a 22-kW photovoltaic array, a sophisticated daylighting design and extensive use of sustainable materials such as steel, concrete, recycled glass terrazzo flooring and reclaimed wood tiles.
Reported 
In Business Madison
: “Yet another UW campus icon could be in the making with the Wisconsin Energy Institute, not just because of its stunning design, but also because of its sustainable purpose. It could well be the place for discoveries that foster greater energy independence while making it possible for alternative forms of energy to displace fossil fuels.”
HOK teamed with Madison-based architect of record Potter Lawson on the design."

World Architecture News (WAN) - Highly Commended - Transport","HOK and Parsons Brinckerhoff collaborated with Amtrak, Akridge and several regional transportation agencies to develop Amtrak’s master plan for making Union Station a center for high-speed rail and commercial activity in downtown Washington, DC. 
Designed by Daniel Burnham, Union Station opened in 1907 as one of the world’s preeminent passenger rail facilities. A national landmark, the station is one of the country’s busiest multimodal transportation hubs. It currently is operating beyond capacity, serving 100,000 passenger trips on 200 Amtrak and commuter trains and hundreds of Metro trains and buses per day.
The Amtrak master plan revitalizes the historic station, triples passenger capacity, doubles the number of trains the station can handle and improves the passenger experience.
The plan positions Union Station as an integral part of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor investment plan by upgrading it to accommodate an additional level of tracks, platforms and concourses below the existing track level. This will support increasing commuter and intercity rail service, including high performance high-speed rail. The plan unlocks up to 6 million square feet of space for transportation-related activities below the station and 3 million square feet of air rights development above.
At the heart of the plan is a new train shed that will welcome passengers to the nation’s capital. HOK’s design brings natural light into the station and creates better connections to Amtrak, commuter rail, transit and other transportation services. A planted, vegetated roof will retain rainwater and temper the interior environment.  The overall design underscores the inherent sustainability of mass transit."

Indy Chamber - Monumental Award","This public hospital and medical center creates a contemporary academic healthcare environment that merges clinical, research and educational missions on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.
The 37-acre complex replaces the nearby Wishard Hospital, presenting an opportunity for a complete transformation that is rare for urban academic medical centers. Rather than create a massive single structure, the team assembled hospital elements into distinct programs, creating a series of linked buildings and spaces. This thoughtful composition creates open courtyards that complement the rigor of internal spaces.
Structured around a central green space, the medical center includes a 315-bed hospital linked by a two-level concourse to a 275-exam room ambulatory care clinic, a faculty office building, a 2,700-car parking garage, two utility buildings and public plazas.
The facade is defined by a contemporary use of glass, metal and precast concrete panels. These simple, modern materials articulate frames, planes and volumes that define internal functions and communicate a broader community identity about the hospital’s programs.
Every aspect of the design focuses on the health and wellness of patients. Reorganizing care delivery for all key departments has streamlined patient movement and eliminated wasted space. The efficient plan enables the new hospital to serve 20 percent more patients in one-third less space.
The public realm framework provides a system of roadways, pathways and landscape between the hospital and the university campus. Positioned at the main entry to the hospital and clinic, The Commonground at Eskenazi Health is a flexible public plaza with water features and a restaurant pavilion.
The Eskenazi Health Sky Farm, a rooftop fruit and vegetable garden with 5,000 square feet of growable space, highlights healthy eating and wellness habits while giving patients and employees opportunities to enjoy nature.
Though the northern climate is challenging and both the hospital and the ambulatory care clinic use 100 percent outdoor air, the project 
achieved LEED Gold certification
.
One of the structural challenges was the incorporation of a nine-story, 60-foot-tall cantilever on the bed tower. The original architectural vision was for a basic cantilever stair system. Late in the design process, this grew into a conference room before ultimately becoming a large piece of the building measuring three bays wide and two bays long. This encompassed not only the cantilever trusses but, due to an offset in the column guide, transfer trusses supporting one of the cantilever trusses. Throughout construction, HOK’s engineering team worked closely with the contractor on deflection control to allow facade construction to advance before the steel erection above the trusses was complete."

The leaders of H&R Block, which was founded in Kansas City, sought to attract a new generation of talented professionals who would be drawn to the vibrant, creative environment offered by the city’s revitalized downtown core.
Three main business drivers guided HOK’s design for the new headquarters: connectivity, collaboration and community.
A distinctive elliptical shape establishes the building’s identity on the downtown skyline. The strikingly elegant shape is enhanced by a high-performance glass skin.
H&R Block wanted the new workplace to help transform its corporate culture. HOK developed a unique open-plan layout with customized furniture, underfloor air for increased comfort, and state-of-the-art technology and communications systems.
The three-story, low-rise portion of the complex includes a modern cafeteria, conference rooms, retail offices and a 330-seat theater that H&R Block shares with the Kansas City Repertory Theater.
Additional building features include a two-story glass lobby with a 20-foot-tall natural stone water wall, an outdoor plaza with water features and a 25,000-sq.-ft. data center.
Five levels of parking under the building accommodate 1,000 automobiles for H&R Block associates and visitors to the neighboring

AIA Kansas City - AIA Craftsmanship Merit Award (Executive Board Room Conference Table)","The design of this new headquarters in downtown Kansas City reflects JE Dunn’s position as one of the country’s leading general contractors.
The six-story office building, developed in tandem with an adjacent 783-space parking structure, anchors the East Village redevelopment, which is transforming a blighted, eight‐block area into a vibrant mixed‐use neighborhood.
To foster a more collaborative corporate culture among employees relocating from several buildings, JE Dunn switched from a traditional workplace environment to an open‐office layout that maximizes daylight, views to the outside and long-term flexibility.
The design complements the surrounding architecture and builds a strong connection to the adjacent limestone government buildings. A curved wall of high-performance glazing on the building’s western facade offers views of the adjacent Ilus W. Davis Civic Mall, Country Club Plaza and downtown Kansas City.
As the first LEED Gold certified corporate headquarters in Missouri, the building reflects JE Dunn’s commitment to sustainable design, construction and operations. Sustainable strategies including ample daylighting, an underfloor HVAC system, rain gardens, a stormwater collection system for irrigation and a green roof all contribute to the creation of a healthy workplace.
Use of natural, simple materials such as exposed concrete, reclaimed wood flooring and perforated carbon steel showcases JE Dunn’s exceptional craftsmanship and skill as a general contractor.          
Amenities include a full-service cafeteria, fitness center, data center, training areas, and easily accessible conference and break rooms on every floor.

As a new architectural icon for downtown Stockton, the multipurpose sports and entertainment venue accommodates a wide range of events while defining the city’s waterfront redevelopment program.
HOK’s master plan for the 24-acre redevelopment includes the arena, Stockton Ballpark, the Sheraton Stockton at Regent Pointe Hotel, retail space and parking. The city of Stockton financed the project to redevelop a former industrial site on the western edge of downtown along the San Joaquin River Delta Waterway.
Design elements and building materials respect the community’s nautical, agricultural and industrial heritage. With views toward downtown and the site’s proximity to the historic waterfront and public park areas, the design team created strong visual connections between the arena and its surroundings. The generous use of glazing exposes a tensile fabric used to cast light or images from floor-to-ceiling that can be seen from a distance. The transparent facade, together with the sweeping wood-clad and metal forms, creates a warm, inviting facility.
Amenities include 344 club seats, a 5,000-sq.-ft. multipurpose room and a team store. Suspended over the lower seating bowl from the roof trusses, 24 luxury “gondola suites” position patrons closer to the action. Club seats on the south side of the bowl have access to an outdoor terrace with extensive views of the water, downtown and adjacent ballpark.
HOK designed the bowl and support spaces to accommodate indoor sports of all types, including hockey, football, soccer and basketball. The bowl also supports end-stage configurations for concerts. A dividable, 5,000-sq.-ft. multipurpose meeting and banquet room that is serviced from the lofty main lobby foyer provides an additional revenue source for the facility."

The complex includes a 65,000-seat soccer stadium surrounded by a manmade lake in the shape of Iraq. The site also features a 10,000-seat secondary stadium, four training soccer fields, team housing facilities, a VIP guesthouse and associated infrastructure buildings.
The selection of Iraq to host the 2013 Gulf Cup of Nations, a biennial soccer tournament for Arab countries, drove the development of the project, which is located outside the southern port city of Basra. Iraq’s Ministry of Youth and Sport wanted this project to spur growth and development in the area while introducing Iraqi athletes to the world stage.
The design of the marquee venue reflects local architectural influences, recalling a proud past while serving as a bridge to a modern era. Inspiration for the main stadium design came from Basra’s timeless and essential icons, from the date palm tree to traditional woven goods. Paying homage to the patterned facades of traditional Iraqi homes, the textured skin also provides a functional response to the local climate.
More than 480,000 square feet of synthetic cladding encases the stadium, forming large panels that interweave with steel columns. The external wrap and roof sheets are supported by a massive steel structure weighing 19,000 tons.
By integrating graceful yet strong forms and surfaces, the architecture expresses the speed, power and perpetual movement of soccer.
The main contractor was Iraqi company Abdullah Al-Jiburi. HOK teamed with this contractor and associate architect/engineer RMC-Partners to deliver the project under a design-build contract. Use of 3D modeling, animation and web meeting technologies helped the multinational team work efficiently while overcoming geographic and language barriers.

Economic Development Council of Kansas City -﻿ Cornerstone Award","HOK’s design team collaborated with Polsinelli, JE Dunn Construction and Plaza Vista developer VanTrust Real Estate to deliver an iconic building that celebrates a world-class law firm. 
The team’s challenge was to redesign a partially constructed mixed-use development on the Country Club Plaza for Polsinelli, the new anchor tenant. The building needed to support Polsinelli’s business needs and culture while creating a valuable asset for VanTrust Real Estate and a mixed-use amenity for the community.
The design team’s plan maximizes reuse of the existing construction while creating a new building orientation. The outward-facing orientation acknowledges the prominence of this location and connects it to the Plaza.
To reduce the building’s visual scale while accommodating Polsinelli’s program needs, the massing appears as separate precast and glass elements connected by a central glass link. By sliding the northern building wing to the east and the southern building wing to the west, the team designed an H-shaped footprint that provides outdoor spaces at entries while maximizing the number of offices along windows. The building’s vertical proportions and distinct precast texture pay homage to the adjacent Plaza architecture. 
A seven-story cantilevered stairwell that winds through the center of the building like a sculptural wood ribbon creates visual and physical connectivity. HOK’s space plan provides strategic adjacencies that optimize operational efficiencies and gives Polsinelli flexibility to reconfigure its space over its 20-year lease.
Combined with ground-floor retail spaces and the adjacent Hotel Sorella, the addition of Polsinelli’s 450 employees has brought increased activity and vitality to the west side of the Country Club Plaza."

The Bulls’ new practice facility is adjacent to their home arena, the United Center on Chicago’s West Side.
HOK designed the Advocate Center to provide a seamless transition as the players move between training, fitness, therapy and nutrition.
The main level houses two full-size basketball courts, expanded locker rooms with hydrotherapy pools, a video room, coaches’ offices, a weight room, a media room and, in the players’ lounge, the first NBA-installed Gatorade Sports Fuel Bar. The second floor contains a green roof terrace, executive offices, conference rooms and a cardio room.
One of the building’s distinct features is the integration of glazing and natural light. As people move from the entry up toward the roofline, glazing becomes increasingly transparent, drawing in natural light while providing privacy where needed.
The facility has embedded technologies that collect player data and stats for real-time analytics. Designed to absorb shockwaves, the floor of the basketball court helps reduce player injuries. To simulate game conditions during practice, a sound system recreates the volume of loud, cheering fans.

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol ,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",https://www.hok.com/design/service/architecture/amsterdam-airport-schiphol-/,,"HOK collaborated with UNStudio and Arup in an international competition to design the expansion of Schiphol Airport’s Terminal A.
 
The team’s design proposal, which was one of four finalists, leverages technology and local culture to create the best airport processes and passenger experience for Schiphol Airport’s newest terminal.
 
Schiphol revolutionized the idea of the “airport city,” setting the precedent for aviation hubs across the world. For this design competition our team’s trend analysis of passenger data demonstrated a clear shift from a dominant vehicular traffic model to an interconnected public transport model. The next step in this evolution thus was to create an intermodal airport city. To support this vision, the proposed design links the new Terminal A to existing public plazas and public transportation. 
By reimagining Schiphol’s center, the intermodal hub becomes a seamless part of the traveler’s journey. Easy connectivity enhances the passenger experience. Transparency, spatial simplicity, clear lines of sight and smooth movement flows all contribute to this concept. 
The terminal’s interior environment enhances the sensory experience of passengers while reflecting the cultural and physical identity of the Netherlands. The seemingly open, transparent ceiling emulates a clear sky and helps with passenger orientation. Controlled openings allow natural light to flood the terminal. Placing plants and interior landscapes in strategic locations helps guide passengers to their destinations. 
The plan organizes functional zones in clear, successive layers so passengers can flow smoothly through the airport. Maintaining equal floor heights, direct lines of sight and simple transitions between the existing and new terminal provides seamless connectivity between the two terminals."

Master Planning","This transit-oriented, mixed-use development in the Ataköy neighborhood of Istanbul features a community designed around six high-rise towers.
Developed by NEF Real Estate, the six-block site includes five 18-story residential towers housing 1,500 apartment and micro-apartment units, and a separate 18-story office tower. A shared podium connects the high-rises with a street-level retail mall that promotes pedestrian activity. Public transportation stations are located at each end of the development.
Because the site sits higher in the north than the south, the design provides a multi-level entry that creates a retail-office bridge between the two main roads.
Limestone, glass-fiber-reinforced concrete panels and ribbon windows on the residential towers create a modular, undulating facade that accentuates the organic flow of the development and provides sunshading and visual harmony. Contrasting this curvilinear form, the podium-level garden apartments are housed in a faceted, zigzag massing that unifies individual tower blocks.
The towers are designed around a central square, allowing natural ventilation and light to the lower levels of the podium. Composed of unique gardens and pavilions, this multi-level linear courtyard promotes activity throughout the development. Bridges and walkways facilitate circulation and a sense of community.
Private residential terraces, plazas and roofscapes add garden spaces that provide visual continuity. Diverse residential amenities emphasize the social aspect of high-density living with a focus on entertainment and health — from private cinemas to basketball courts.
Building information modeling tools helped the design team maximize efficiencies. During the design phase, high market demand for residential units required one of the six towers originally designed for commercial office use to be redesigned as a residential tower in a compressed timeframe. The team also streamlined the constructability of the curvilinear concrete spandrel panels on four of the residential towers by devising a modular system that used a limited number of molds to create the complex forms seen throughout the development. "

The project’s scale and the existence of five “historically contributing,” early 20
th
-century row houses on 14th Street required the project to be approved by the Historic Preservation Review Board and the District of Columbia Office of Planning. 
HOK’s team designed the massing and materials to be respectful of but not subservient to the historic fabric. Massing and details at the corner of 14th and W streets help establish a strong presence on the corner. The design restored the facades of the row houses on 14th Street to a historically appropriate appearance and integrated the interiors into the new construction. On W Street, the materials and massing change, with higher floors stepping back to create terraces for the units and the facade modulating to respect the shorter historic Victorian brownstones across the street. A modern facade on the new YMCA entrance draws attention from 14th Street. 
A key to the project is the reconstruction of the YMCA Anthony Bowen, which was named for the formerly enslaved minister who founded the nation’s first independent African-American YMCA in 1853.

HOK is leading the architecture, interior design, medical planning and landscape design for the largest hospital redevelopment implemented in the UK under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding scheme.
St Bartholomew’s was founded in 1123 and is Britain’s oldest hospital. Serving a population of more than three million people, the hospital’s new nine-story King George V Building includes the Barts Heart Centre, the UK’s largest specialized cardiovascular facility.
Some existing historic buildings on the site were refurbished, conserved and integrated with new construction to create the specialized cancer and cardiac center. The new building, which incorporates the retained King George V block, features a contemporary design of stone and brick that complements the existing Georgian architecture of London’s historic Smithfield area.
Medical professionals at the new Barts Heart Centre will perform more heart surgeries, MRI scans and CT scans than any other facility in the world. State-of-the-art facilities include 10 operating suites, 10 catheterization laboratories, 250 general cardiac beds, 58 critical care beds and 40 coronary care unit beds. Clinicians estimate that more than 1,000 lives could be saved every year because of the state-of-the-art treatment and expanded patient access to a broad range of clinical trials.
The landscape design restores the main square on the site — originally designed by James Gibbs in the 1730s — as a fully accessible space for patient relaxation. Planting and paving materials enhance the surrounding Grade I and II-listed buildings and historic central fountain that provides a welcome green space in the heart of the hospital.
Part of the redevelopment has achieved an ‘Excellent’ rating in the NEAT (NHS Environmental Assessment Tool) certification, an independent green building certification method.

The project celebrates the rich variety of city living by integrating a healthcare facility, market-rate and affordable housing, contemporary offices, a historic building, parking and landscaped gardens on a compact urban site.
Phase 2 of the development includes the completion of the 100-unit residential building (market-rate and affordable apartments), as well as 3,230 square feet of office space within an existing Grade II-listed historic hall. These additions complement the 
project’s first phase
, which was also designed by HOK and included an outpatient orthopedic clinic and 45 apartment units in the residential building.
Located near Regent’s Park in one of London’s most sensitive urban environments, the residential building is arranged around two landscaped courtyards. It incorporates sustainable features such as ground-source heat pumps, biofuel boilers, and green walls and roofs. Primary facades are composed of Spanish limestone that integrates public art in the form of colored glass fins depicting abstract images of MRI scans.
Vertical bay windows fabricated from anodized aluminum and glass accent the building design. To reflect the sun and maximize light, the elevations overlooking the courtyard are clad in light zinc tiles.
At the center of the site, the hospital’s former waiting hall is connected to the building’s main entrance on Bolsover Street. The technical requirements of retaining this 1927-listed building in situ involved careful preservation of the historic structure’s Roman Classical architectural character while creating a flexible interior office design.
Large murals that dominate the double-height space inspired the muted design palette. Textured upholstery, timber detailing and bespoke furniture ensure that the space fulfills tenant needs and complements the design aesthetic of the original building.
A glazed reception area with double-height ceilings opens onto a courtyard with stunning landscaped gardens, providing a place to escape the busy London streets.

Sustainable Consulting","Tampa International Airport is in the midst of a transformation that affects nearly every part of its campus. 
At the core of these changes is the airport’s desire to build on its legacy of outstanding customer service by expanding and modernizing its space to better serve passengers.
The Skanska / HOK design-build team is leading the terminal and airside project, which will be complete in 2018. This project is part of an initial expansion phase that will double the capacity of the airport, which currently serves more than 17 million passengers per year, while elevating the travel experience for guests.
The design transforms the existing facility into an open and airy terminal, with primary east- and west-facing curtain wall and metal panels enveloping the terminal’s concrete aesthetic. Four outdoor terraces provide spaces for customers to relax and enjoy the breezes and sunset views.
The project adds more than 60,000 square feet of useable space—enough for a football field to fit comfortably within the existing floor plate—to the terminal’s third-floor transfer level. The project adds 38,000 square feet of enclosed new space. HOK’s design creates a unified, visually accessible space across the east-west axis. It includes retail, restaurants, a coffee bar, lounge spaces, work space for business travelers, a family zone, vertical circulation and public art. Four shuttle lobbies are being relocated.
The remainder of the project affects all public spaces, with new airside concessions spaces, new food courts, functional improvements to all gate lounges and a campus-wide art program."

Mayors Business Celebration Awards  Development of the Year Award","HOK provided design services for an extensive redevelopment led by The Koman Group to accommodate employees of The Laclede Group in the company’s new downtown headquarters in the former General American Building.
As one of the “youngest” buildings in the National Register of Historic Places, the postmodern landmark structure, renamed 700 Market, was originally designed by Philip Johnson. Because of the dramatically sloped grade, Johnson’s style of designing buildings on a clean, flat plane, where they can meet the site, had not been realized. The design team’s challenge was to redevelop the site to meet the needs of the new users within while preserving the character of this iconic building.
To resolve the grade issue, the design creates a grand flight of stairs leading to a 
formal entry plaza
. Immaculately detailed in concrete and simple forms, this entry plaza honors Johnson’s original vision. 
Tucked into the grade of the site, the 
east courtyard
 creates intimate meeting areas along the side of the building. With a lush backdrop to the city, this space gives building occupants respite from the public realm. 
An 18,000-sq.-ft. 
rooftop garden courtyard
 on the building’s fifth floor offers space for collaboration and socialization. This terrace provides sweeping views of the Gateway Arch and St. Louis skyline. The green roof’s vegetated planter trays, trees, shrubs and sodded lawn area help insulate the building and conserve energy while managing the stormwater. Highlighted by a dynamic lighting system, the terrace features a fitness path, programmable lawn and paved event space that accommodates corporate or civic functions. "
Suvarnabhumi International Airport Midfield Satellite Concourse,"Bangkok, Thailand",https://www.hok.com/design/service/architecture/suvarnabhumi-international-airport-midfield-satellite-concourse/,"SIZE: 2.325 million sq. ft. / 216,000 sq. m.

SERVICES: Architecture
Interior Design","As a natural extension of the existing terminal, this new midfield satellite concourse provides an exceptional travel experience for passengers.
The four-level concourse building will accommodate up to 15 million annual passengers and have 28 aircraft contact gates, eight of which will serve Code F A380 aircrafts. A new underground automated people mover and baggage handling system connects the building to the main terminal.
A barrel-vaulted section and alternating bands of glass and solid material in the new midfield concourse blend the interior with the spatial quality of the main terminal.
The concourse’s metal-clad standing seam roof is supported by a simple arched beam and tree column structure. This is more economical, energy efficient and easier to maintain than the existing terminal’s roof, which is made up of tensile fabric and exposed arched trusses.
In contrast to the existing terminal, the interior of the new concourse is modern but balanced with subtle cultural references that provide a sense of “Thai-ness.” The ceiling is made up of crisscrossing arched ribs infilled with timber-colored slats. The resulting diamond-patterned ceiling recalls traditional silk cloth patterns and regional basket weaving textures. Interior gardens remind travelers of Thailand’s tropical nature while drawing greenery and natural light deep into the concourse."

Structural Engineering","This adaptive reuse project anchors the Cortex Innovation Community, a 200-acre mixed-use urban research district in midtown St. Louis.
Originally constructed in 1948 as a telephone handset factory, the three-story building was redeveloped by Wexford Science & Technology to provide flexible laboratory and office space for tenants involved in life sciences, research, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship.
Preserving and highlighting the masonry structure’s historic character, the design team retrofitted the building with modern, high-performance systems that enable it to function as a state-of-the-art research and office facility. Floor openings cut into the middle of the building allow skylights to illuminate a courtyard, light wells, the building’s interior and a two-story concourse. By creating informal meeting and collaboration areas, the concourse functions as the “mixing space” for the complex.
Large floor plates and highly adaptable mechanical systems enable @4240 to support a variety of tenants, from small startups to larger, more established research organizations. The space includes fully equipped conference rooms, open meeting areas, green spaces, cafés and casual gathering spots.
The LEED Platinum-certified project features extensive use of renewable building materials and energy efficiency measures, including e a 50-kV photovoltaic array. The design and construction team worked within historic guidelines to restore the building’s deteriorating brick facade, add insulation under a new roof and upgrade the industrial windows with historically accurate, insulated replacement glazing. The building is 45 percent more energy efficient than a typical lab and office facility.
Relocating the building’s main entry promotes interaction with the newly planned Cortex Commons, a park-like green space that serves as the community hub for the district.
Located within walking distance of a planned public transit station, the building is near Washington University/BJC Medical Center and Saint Louis University. This location provides convenient access to additional scientific resources and partnership opportunities."

The team designed the campus as a prototype for the Singapore Ministry of Health’s effort to provide high-quality, affordable care to all.
The facility, which includes Jurong Community Hospital, provides seamless integration of care on a single site. Close management ensures integration at the hospitals’ infrastructure, administrative and clinical levels. The hospitals are designed to share service facilities such as digital imaging, pharmacy, catering, medical records, storage and training facilities.
Sustainable design strategies create a facility that functions like a vertical healing garden. Based on the design team’s client mandate to give “every patient a window,” the design brings plants, gardens and daylight into each patient’s view. Controlled access to vegetation on terraces provides a therapeutic environment for healing. Oriented to reduce solar gain and capture prevailing breezes, the unique floor arrangement allows for double the amount of natural ventilation. The project also includes solar thermal hot water heating and a large photovoltaic array. It has been rated Platinum under Singapore’s Green Mark program.
The team used detailed computational fluid dynamics models, shading analysis, climate analysis, daylight modeling and energy modeling to develop the design to optimize energy efficiency and the patient experience. 
As design and medical planning consultant, HOK collaborated with the Singapore Ministry of Health and a team that included CPG Corporation (prime architect and architect of record) and Studio 505 (design collaborator focusing on building envelope development).

MEED Quality Awards for Projects - Best Building Project of the Year","The Central Bank of Kuwait’s new headquarters building is a symbol of the country’s significant economic power in the 21st century. 
Located in the Sharq commercial and financial district, it is a new landmark on Kuwait City’s skyline. The design creates a modern, comfortable work environment for bank staff.
The office building is formed by a triangular, truncated pyramid tower intersected by a podium that houses reception and banking halls, conference facilities, dining and banquet rooms, and a museum.
The geometric forms echo the geometry and order of Kuwaiti architecture. The two walls facing the sun are predominantly stone, while the northern elevation is glass. Viewed from the city, the stone facades block the intense desert sun and reflect the solidity and permanence of the Central Bank. Horizontal slots with recessed window openings minimize solar gain. At night, the all-glass viewing platform at the top of the building glows like a lighthouse. In contrast to the stone facades, the transparent north elevation looks out across the Gulf, expressing Kuwait’s historic openness to commerce and trade
.
 Panoramic views of the Gulf provide a constant reminder of the sea’s important role in the region.
Visitors enter the building through an expansive lobby. The wall opposite the reception desk and adjacent to the escalators features full-height, backlit, onyx pleated panels.
A retail bank branch on the ground floor provides banking services to staff and the community. On the second level, a 240-400-seat conference facility accommodates corporate events and can be subdivided for smaller gatherings. Overlooking the Gulf, a 330-person auditorium is cantilevered beyond the line of the angled eastern elevation. A two-story juice bar at the opposite end offers views west toward the city.

The building’s transparency links the facility with the campus and creates excitement about health and wellness. This transparency continues as students entering the building are welcomed into a large, three-story space. The main atrium features smaller fitness “neighborhoods” that create an approachable experience for all levels of users.
Fitness components include a two-court gymnasium, a three-lane indoor running track, cardio and strength training areas, multipurpose studios for group fitness, racquetball courts, athletic fields, a wellness clinic with a demonstration kitchen, exterior exercise terraces and an outdoor pool for recreation and competition.
HOK’s design team engaged ASU students, faculty and staff in workshops throughout the design process and incorporated their input into the design.
To support ASU’s guidelines for environmental sustainability, the team designed the project for LEED Gold certification. The building orientation capitalizes on the site’s east-west axis to maximize energy efficiency. A facade of north-facing windows overlooks the adjacent quadrangle and allows natural light to permeate through the building.
The design complements the unified character of the campus and builds on the energy of nearby student life buildings.
HOK designed the project in association with Architekton."
