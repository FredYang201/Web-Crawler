1111 Sunset Boulevard,"Los Angeles, California","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Hangzhou Wangchao Center,"Hangzhou, China","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village.

Vertical Medina,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport – International Arrivals Facility,"Seattle, Washington","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Raffles University Iskandar,"Iskandar, Malaysia","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses.

Bahrain Bay Master Plan,"Manama, Bahrain","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

WeHo SMART City Strategic Plan,"West Hollywood, California","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands.

Longgang Tian’an Cyber Park,"Shenzhen, China","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

BBVA Madrid Headquarters – Interiors,"Madrid, Spain","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes.

OKO Tower,"Moscow, Russia","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Nanjing Xiaguan Riverfront Master Plan,"Nanjing, China","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands.

Feidi Next C Master Plan,"Tianjin, China","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes.

Oakland Museum of California,"Oakland, California","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Brunswick School – Upper School Renovation,"Greenwich, Connecticut","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands.

Peaks Resort and Spa Interiors,"Telluride, Colorado","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

UBS Ultra-High Net Worth Client Offices – Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes.

World Trade Center Marketing Suite,"New York, New York","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands.

Milliken WAY Carpet Design,"New York, New York","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes.

Times Square Site One,"New York, New York","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses.

San Francisco Food Bank Donor Wall,"San Francisco, California","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance.

United Gulf Bank,"Manama, Bahrain","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Weyerhaeuser Corporate Headquarters,"Federal Way, Washington","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue

Great Lakes Naval Training Center – Hostess House,"Great Lakes, Illinois","Embodying a commitment to sustainable placemaking, the India Basin project proposes the transformation of acres of overgrown former industrial lands on San Francisco's bay into an active waterfront destination and a vibrant, diverse village. Developed in collaboration with city government agencies and residents of the area, SOM’s comprehensive design reconnects surrounding communities with the shoreline, cultivates economic opportunities, and provides mixed-income housing.
A rugged piece of urban land located north of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, the site provides connection to the tranquility of San Francisco Bay and a breathtaking panoramic view that spans from downtown San Francisco to the East Bay mountains. The multiphase, mixed-use project creates a complete community that is human in scale with all basic services and amenities located within short walking distance. It interweaves parks, plazas, and open space with new pedestrian and bicycle-friendly connections, as well as buildings for residential, commercial, and community-serving purposes. Serving as the gateway to this new neighborhood and parkland, the India Basin Market Plaza and Boardwalk will provide a local and regional amenity for culture, commerce, and recreation.
The design also embraces the existing wild character of the land, responding to its specific hydrology and topography and celebrating the connection to San Francisco’s ecological history. A robust stormwater management strategy links streetscape streams and bioswales (landscape elements that remove silt from runoff water) with a landscape of canals, reservoirs, and wetlands. Captured water will be retained for irrigation, street cleaning, and other uses. India Basin preserves the site’s salt marshes and grasslands, while forming an attractive and safe place to live for current and future residents.","SOM Projects Featured in A+U's San Francisco-Focused Issue
