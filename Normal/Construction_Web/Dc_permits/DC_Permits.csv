This is the parking garage located at the Children's National Research and Innovation Campus (former Walter Reed site in DC). 

The solar array will consist of 2,444 solar modules, each with 470 Watts of power, for a total of 1148.68 kilowatts of clean energy capacity. DCRA PLEASE NOTE: the acela/project application system would not allow me to input a system larger than 1200 modules. The total square footage of the proposed array would be 70,980 square feet, remaining fully within the existing parking structure footprint. A total of fifty-two (52) piers would be attached to the existing building structure to support the array. 

The solar canopy will be a Community Solar Energy Facility (CREF), developed in conjunction with the District of Columbia’s Department of Energy and Environment’s “Solar for All” program. The energy generated by the CREF will be donated to low- and moderate-income residents in Washington, DC.
